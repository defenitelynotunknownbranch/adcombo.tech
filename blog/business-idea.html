Sales.</p><p>You’re asking <em>“How can I sell a product that doesn’t exist?”</em></p><p>Exactly. It’s tough to sell a product that doesn’t exist.</p><p><strong>...and that’s precisely the point.</strong></p><p>If you CAN pre-sell this product before it even exists, you’ll KNOW that your idea is good.</p><p>When I started Ladder I had already closed $20k in recurring revenue before I quit my job.</p><p>Did I have a product? No.<br>Did I have a website? No.<br>Did I even have a pitch deck? No.</p><p>What I <em>did have</em> was a problem worth solving, and a vision of what the solution could be.</p><p>The startup founders I talked to were working with 5-6 different marketing specialists, consultants, and agencies each, all of whom weren’t talking to each other and some of whom were ripping them off.</p><p>They were desperate for someone to come in and clean up the mess.</p><p>I offered to do everything their current consultants were doing, but with one point of contact and a 20% money back guarantee if I didn’t hit their targets.</p><p>The way you do it doesn’t matter. What matters is that you actually find out what people are willing to pay up front for.</p><p>If people are feeling so much pain from the problem you’re solving, that they’ll stump up their cash ahead of time, you’re on to a winner.</p><p>You can offer a money-back guarantee like I did, but It’s important that you <strong>actually get people to fork over their cash.</strong></p><p>The reason? People lie.</p><p>Your Mom doesn’t want to hurt your feelings, so of course she’ll say your idea is the best idea in the world. Your friends also don’t want to hurt your feelings, so they tell you to go for it. Your colleagues don’t even like you, so they tell you what you want to hear so you’ll go away.</p><p>Well, actions speak louder than words; if people aren’t forking over cold, hard cash, you don’t yet have an business venture worth working on yet.</p><p>I know - it’s uncomfortable to ask people to take a risk on you. It feels dishonest to take someone’s money before giving them a tangible product in return.</p><h3>Get comfortable asking people to take a risk on your business venture</h3><p>You’re also going to have to sell your vision to:</p><ul role="list"><li>your first employees <em>(who by all rights should be working elsewhere for more money and better hours)</em></li><li>early investors <em>(who’ve seen thousands of overly-optimistic companies fail and have plenty of other great ideas to choose from)</em></li><li>your friends and family <em>(who I guarantee will be concerned about your mental health and finances)</em>.</li></ul><p>Besides, people pay for products that don’t exist yet all the time. Heard of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>? Bought airline or concert tickets? Booked a hotel? Pre-ordered a hot new video game?</p><p>If there’s enough demand for the product, there will be at least a couple of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopter">early adopters</a> who will buy it before it exists.

Brainstorm a list of those people and email each one with something similar to this:</p><p><em>Subject: Working on a new business: Doggie Treats.</em></p><p>Hey Dave,</p><p>I’m selling premium dog biscuits on a subscription for $50 per month. Taking 20 pre-orders at that price.</p><p>PayPal me $50 at example@email.com if you want in.</p><p>Know anyone else that would be interested? Feel free to forward this email.</p><p>Any questions, just hit reply.</p><p>Sure, it feels uncomfortable writing that email.</p><p>Nobody likes to ask your friends and family for money. But if you are providing genuine value, it won’t feel uncomfortable for them. They’ll be happy that you’re solving a problem for them.</p><p>But if people who already like you react negatively to your new business idea… then why would people who’ve never met you buy from you?</p><p>Time to move on to the next one.</p><h3><strong>Get out of the building</strong></h3><p>This is basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Blank">Steve Blank’s</a> catchphrase. As a serial entrepreneur, Stanford professor and grandfather of the Lean Startup movement, you should listen to him. What he’s <a href="https://steveblank.com/2010/03/11/teaching-entrepreneurship-%E2%80%93-by-getting-out-of-the-building/">talking about</a> is the value in actually talking to customers.</p><p>This is the <strong>#1 mistake I’ve seen people make</strong> (and I’ve made myself). It’s nice and comfortable to stay inside your office and dream about this perfect business venture you’re creating. As long as you stay in that building you can continue to dream, and everything’s right with the world.</p><p>Going outside means interacting with the public. It means pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. Most of all it means rejection.</p><p>The real world is imperfect. People are illogical. The dream you had about building the perfect company is often shattered upon first contact with your potential customers.</p><p><strong>In the real world, people tell you no.</strong></p><p>That sucks. But let me tell you what’s worse - working 80 hours a week for 3 months and spending thousands of dollars of your own money only to THEN going into the world and hear that big fat <strong>NO</strong>.</p><p>In the early days of Ladder, I spent a whole year of evenings and weekends theorizing new business ideas that never made it past the pitch deck stage.</p><p>Seriously - they never even saw the light of day. I was killing myself working 80 hours a week, earning half my previous salary and sacrificing time with my friends and loved ones… for nothing.</p><p>I was told to ‘get out of the building’ time and time again by lots of smart people, but it took a whole year of wasted effort for me to really internalize it. It was only after I really started listening to customers that I realized how wrong my theories were. From there we made changes to our business venture that helped us triple in revenue over the next 6 months and hire 15 people.</p><p>Don’t make the same mistake as I did, for as long as I did.</p><p><strong>Remember: in theory, there’s no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is.</strong></p><p>So get outside the building and ask potential customers these questions:</p><h3>Interview Structure Example</h3><p>1) Hey, I&#x27;m trying to learn more about __________ for a project I&#x27;m working on, do you have five minutes to help me out?<br>2) Tell me about a time you __________.<br>3) What was the worst thing about __________?<br>4) How do you solve __________ today?<br>5) What sucks about that solution?<br>6) If a better solution existed, where would you hear about it?<br>7) Thanks you’ve been incredibly helpful.

The one above is modified from the <a href="https://leanstack.com/why-lean-canvas/">Ash Maurya</a> version, from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Running-Lean-Iterate-Works-OReilly/dp/1449305172">Running Lean</a>, which we definitely recommend if you like the content of this post. You should also check out Steve Blank&#x27;s <a href="http://www.guidearama.com/guides/fwb.html">worksheets</a> and Alex Osterwalder&#x27;s <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc">Business Model Canvas</a>.</p><p>But what’s important is that it all fits on one page.</p><p>This is much, much shorter than the average business plan, and that’s why it works.</p><p><em>“If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.” - Blaise Pascal</em></p><p>Fitting your entire business venture on one page forces you to focus only on what’s important.</p><p>Going through this process forces clarity of thinking and essentialism; stripping your random thoughts back into a clear, differentiated proposition. Asking yourself “what’s really important?” at every step can really be a transformative exercise.</p><p>It’s really tough to do this. But you’ll see how immediately insightful it is once you try.</p><p>Just by forcing yourself to fit your ideas to this format, you’ll find that quite a few of them that seemed magical in your head, are actually pretty faulty or mundane once you write them down.</p><p>Because it’s all on one page, you can quickly understand most of what you need to know about the business at a glance. This lets you compare and contrast multiple business ideas.</p><p>Once you do settle on your new business idea, you’ll need this level of clarity anyway if you’re really going to sell your vision to investors, employees, and customers.</p><p>Got it? Good. Let’s go through this step by step:</p><h3><strong>Problem / Solution</strong></h3><p>What problem(s) are you actually trying to solve? How does your solution fix that problem? If you don’t have a clear idea of this you’ll really struggle to fill out the rest.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0cda7747fd767a469230_problem_solution-1473262446659.png" alt="problem solution graph"></div></figure><ul role="list"><li>Building a business will be much easier if the problem is one that you yourself have.</li><li>Make sure to limit this to one problem if possible, no more than three.</li><li>Only list one solution.

From there it should be easy to figure out where those people can be reached (channels) and what people might influence their decision.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0cdac8a171891c393cbf_customer_channels_influencers-1473262556957.png" alt="customer channels influencers infographic"></div></figure><ul role="list"><li>Make sure you pick customers that feel the pain of the problem more than anyone</li><li>Limit ‘channels’ down to 2-3 max; in practice it’s rare more than 1 channel works anyway</li><li>Give easy to understand descriptions of your customers persona; what’s important?</li></ul><h3><strong>Alternatives / Concepts</strong></h3><p>List a couple of products your potential customers are currently using to solve the problem.

Now, what if you had to fit it into a Tweet?</p><p>If you thought it was tough to condense your idea down to a one-page lean canvas, try cutting everything down further to under 140 characters.</p><p><em>Why is this useful?</em></p><p>You’re in an elevator. You recognize a famous investor who is in there with you. This is someone you respect, with experience and resources that could help you take your business to the next level. You get talking and they ask you what your business does.</p><p><em>What do you say?</em></p><p>You only have a couple of minutes to explain yourself before they get off at their floor. That’s why they call it an ‘elevator pitch’ but it can easily be a Tweet, the way someone introduces you at a cocktail party, or how you explain it to a five-year-old. The format doesn’t matter; what matters is that you can deliver a clear, concise and interesting description in a small space.</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><h3><strong>Anatomy of an elevator pitch</strong></h3><p>There are tons of elevator pitch templates out there, but they all look something similar to this:</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0cdbf103953446fbb5e8_startup_madlibs-1473263077166.png" alt="startup madlibs"></div></figure><p><br><em>Source: </em><a href="https://fi.co/madlibs"><em>https://fi.co/madlibs</em></a></p><p>Let’s go through the different sections:</p><h4><strong>Name of Company</strong></h4><p>I hope this one’s self explanatory…</p><h4><strong>Defined Offering</strong></h4><p>What your product actually is. A website? A mobile app? Avoid getting too fancy here; imagine explaining what it is to your mother. If she wouldn’t understand the jargon, ditch it.</p><h4><strong>Defined Audience</strong></h4><p>Who buys your product? If you’re selling to businesses, try a job title / company type / company size combination (marketing managers at eCommerce businesses with &lt;20 employees). If you’re going the consumer route talk about lifestyles, demographics and what products they buy (wealthy urban females 25-34 who enjoy Prada bags).</p><h4><strong>Solve A Problem</strong></h4><p>What do you DO for that audience? How do you make their life easier or better? What pain do you help them avoid? Use words that everyone can understand and relate to.</p><h4><strong>Secret Sauce</strong></h4><p>What makes you different? What do you do that makes your product so special? This has to be something meaningful and credible. Bonus points if it’s something that’s hard for incumbents to replicate, like “disappearing photo messages” (Snapchat) or “all-electric sports cars” (Tesla).</p><p>A few more pointers:</p><ul role="list"><li>Avoid adjectives - ‘first’, ‘only’, ‘cheapest’ or ‘best’</li><li>Go niche - a small initial market is more realistic</li><li>No buzzwords - cut the jargon from your pitch</li><li>Short length - you only have a small window to pitch</li></ul><p>If you do this right, the investor will be able to answer the following questions:</p><ul role="list"><li>What does this company offer?</li><li>Which of my friends would buy this?</li><li>Why would I tell them to buy this?</li></ul><p>And remember, it doesn’t have to be an investor; you’ll need to give this pitch to potential new employees, new prospects, the press and even your mother-in-law; make sure it works for a wide range of people and practice and refine it constantly.</p><p>So let’s give this a go; here’s that template again:</p><p><strong>My company, ____________ (name of company)<br>is developing ____________ (defined offering)<br>to help ____________ (defined audience)<br><em>____</em> (solve a problem)<br>with ____________ (secret sauce)</strong></p><p>…and here’s the elevator pitch for the course business idea we tested:</p><p>My company, <strong>Z21</strong> (name of company) <strong>is developing an in-person course</strong> (defined offering) <strong>to help potential entrepreneurs</strong> (defined audience) <strong>test market demand for their business ideas</strong> (solve a problem) <strong>with a lean process to avoid wasted money and effort</strong> (secret sauce).</p><p>Now we remove the template scaffolding to make sure it flows:</p><p><em>My company, Z21 is developing an in-person course to help potential entrepreneurs test market demand for their business ideas, with a lean process to avoid wasted money and effort.</em></p><p>Can we make it even more concise? The template helps, but feel free to ditch it if you can make the pitch clearer without it, just make sure the essential information is still there.</p><p><em>Z21 is an in-person course teaching potential entrepreneurs lean principles so they can test market demand for their ideas without wasting time and money.</em></p><p>Can we improve further?</p><p><em>At Z21 we teach entrepreneurs how to test their business ideas before quitting their job.</em></p><p>Hey - pretty close to the post title, right? ?</p><p>Notice that the tangible example “quitting your job” helps us make the “wasting time and money” less ethereal and more understandable? We can also just use the word “teach” and let them assume it’s an in-person course. We don’t mention lean principles here, but the very fact that we think entrepreneurs should ‘test’ their business ideas gives that away (if they’re already familiar with lean principles).</p><p>Hearing this pitch, my grandmother wouldn’t have any clue HOW someone would TEST a business idea, but <strong>she CAN understand the dangers of quitting your job to pursue a poor idea.</strong></p><p>You could imagine her reading this headline in the paper, cutting out the article and giving it to me if she knew I wanted to start my own business. If you can’t imagine the same scenario, your elevator pitch is probably too full of jargon.</p><p>Of course, there is a time and place for jargon.</p><p>People use it because, <em>IF both parties understand the meaning</em>, it can be an efficient way of achieving your goal of fitting a lot of information in a few words. It also can have a tribal bonding effect - convincing them you’re ‘one of us’ because you use the same words.</p><p>For example, I could use this:</p><p><em>Z21 teaches the lean startup methodology to wantrepreneurs so they can validate their ideas without burning too much personal runway.</em></p><h3>Let me explain the jargon:</h3><h4><strong>“Z21”</strong></h4><p>So I didn’t explain this earlier, but the name Z21 is actually jargon, homage to Peter Thiel’s popular book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296">Zero to One</a>. Because this book is entirely about how to avoid market failure for your startup, it’s a fitting reference that a tech enthusiast is likely to get.</p><h4><strong>“lean startup methodology”</strong></h4><p>From this they’ll know I’m referring to the principles outlined in Eric Ries’ book “<a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">The Lean Startup</a>”. That’s a whole book worth’s of information condensed into 3 words and importantly, it tells them I’ve probably read it. Even if they haven’t read this book, the word ‘methodology’ makes me sound smart and they understand what probably understand what a ‘startup’ is and what ‘lean’ means.</p><p>If I really wanted to impress I could have said “customer development methodology” which would hint that I’ve read Steve Blank’s “<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/0989200507">The Four Steps to the Epiphany</a>”. This book came before the Lean Startup and Steve Blank invented many of the principles Eric Ries later popularized, but it saw much less mainstream success. Because it was less popular, the odds are much lower that they’ll get the reference, but if they do, it’ll lead to a much deeper level of respect (like someone casually dropping the name of an obscure band that you both turn out to love, even though most people have never heard of them)</p><h4><strong>“wantrepreneurs”</strong></h4><p>I’m not sure if it was coined by Noah Kagan of <a href="http://www.appsumo.com/sumo-business-blueprint-live-op/">AppSumo</a>, but he certainly popularized the term. It refers to people who are in love with the idea of starting a business, but never make the right moves to actually do it. This is precisely the audience we’re trying to help with our course, and because has a lot of cache in the entrepreneur community, using this term will immediately get who our audience is.</p><h4><strong>“validate”</strong></h4><p>This is just a fancy word for ‘test’ but it’s what much of the literature uses. I think this is because the word ‘test’ has been watered down by the masses, so it doesn’t really mean what they intend it to mean anymore; a scientific test to prove the hypothesis that your business has a market.</p><h4><strong>“burning too much personal runway”</strong></h4><p>Your ‘runway’ or ‘burn rate’ is just a calculation of how much money you have until you run out. The best explanation of this I’ve seen is by popular investor <a href="http://avc.com/2011/12/burn-rate/">Fred Wilson</a>. Startups are almost always unprofitable (at least at first) which is why they need to raise money, and why they need to calculate how long it’ll last. So personal runway is simply how much of your own money you can afford to spend on your startup before you have to give up. The biggest way to affect your personal runway is to quit your job, so this reference ties very nicely in with what we’re helping ‘wantrepreneurs’ avoid.</p><p>By now you should get why people use Jargon despite all the confusion it can cause; if it works, you instantly gain more credibility, respect, and you convey a lot of information all at once.</p><p>But be very careful.</p><p>If the person doesn’t get the reference, you risk alienating them and turning them off your product completely; it’s a high risk, high reward strategy.</p><p>What you’re also likely to find, is that people nod along as if they understand the jargon (because maybe they heard it once and think they kind of get what it means), but then just when you think you’ve made the sale, you realize they had no idea what you’ve been talking about.</p><p>At <a href="../index-4.htm?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=business-idea">Ladder</a> this happens to me all the time when I explain that <a href="growth-hacking.html">we use an ‘Agile’ process</a>. People don’t want to look dumb I guess, and they probably hear the word Agile a lot so they think they know what it means, but very few people really have internalized it.</p><p>We’ll be within grasping-distance of closing a deal... and they’ll ask for a 12-month <a href="marketing-plan.html">marketing plan</a> before they’ll sign. Avoiding wasting time creating useless 12-month plans is really the main reason Agile exists, so by asking for that plan they’re betraying the fact that they really don’t ‘get’ what they were about to buy.</p><p>So use jargon if you must, but use it at your own risk!</p><p>[leadform color_scheme=&quot;dark&quot; btn_color=&quot;red&quot; cta=&quot;Talk to a strategist&quot; heading=&quot;Stop guessing and start growing your business!

The unit economics of a business venture is simply how much it costs that business to sell one ‘unit’ of the product, and how much money it makes from the sale of that one unit.</p><p>To work this out, you need to understand your ‘marketing funnel’; map out all the steps someone goes through to become a customer, and do some analysis to figure out how many make it from one stage to the other. It’s called a ‘funnel’ because at every stage, fewer people make it through. Only a small percentage of people who visit your site will get to the end and buy something.</p><p><strong>This type of analysis is just as useful even if you haven’t sold your first unit.</strong></p><p>That’s because it forces you to make assumptions about your business model. How cheaply can we attract visitors to our site? What percentage of visitors will turn into customers? How long will they stay customers? How many friends will they refer?</p><p>Once you’ve made your best guesses, you can see if your business is likely to make money, and if it is, what benchmarks you need to hit to make that happen.</p><p><em>P.S.

Sure they think it’d be cool to ‘go viral’ but even then they’re using the term wrong. For example, a celebrity Tweeting out something that then gets seen by a million people doesn’t mean it has ‘gone viral’. It’s only ‘viral’ if those people then share it with more than 1 other person each, who in turn spread it to more than 1 other person each, and so on till it spreads throughout the World.</p><p>You might recognize that’s exactly how a virus spreads (hence the name). If I give you and two other people in my office a cold, they might pass it on to three other people each themselves, now we have nine people infected. If the same rate continues, we’ll have 27 (9 x 3), then 81, then 243. Woah, that escalated quickly!</p><p>Retention is not as powerful, but it is <strong>arguably much more important</strong> because it’s the sign of a good product.</p><p>Rather than being a flash in the pan-viral product, if your users stick around that’s a stable base you can count on, and build on. If they don’t stick around you’ll always be having to pay to attract new customers through marketing, to replace those that left; a leaky bucket.</p><p>To illustrate the relative power of these two metrics, take a look at the growth rates of a user base at different levels of virality and retention.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0cdba972e3d01e90e52b_virality_and_retention-1473264625826.png" alt="virality and retention"></div></figure><h3> </h3><h2><strong>Minimum Viable Brand</strong></h2><p>Next step is branding.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0cdcbfdd7d720781796f_mad_men-1473264808575.png" alt="mad men funny image"></div></figure><p>OK, calm down.</p><p>No need to go into Don Draper mode - we’re not talking a big expensive branding exercise.</p><p>All you need right now is a minimum viable brand.</p><p>We just need to establish the basics, so you (and your employees) are consistently saying the right things, in the right way, with the right accompanying visuals.</p><p>Consistency breeds familiarity.

However, we will give you enough of an overview that you can confidentially approach these tools and get a basic in-market test live.</p><h3><strong>Building Landing Pages</strong></h3><p>Your instinct is going to be to get a fully functioning website up. Resist that urge. It can cost thousands of dollars to pay a freelancer or agency to build you a website, or take you hundreds of hours to build it yourself via WordPress or SquareSpace.</p><p>This is a distraction at this stage; you don’t even know if the idea is worth all that time and money yet!</p><p>Do yourself a favor and build yourself a simple one-page site, called a ‘landing page’, first. You can do this with <a href="marketing-stack.html">a number of different tools</a>, but we prefer Unbounce because it’s a simple drag and drop tool which supports <a href="ab-testing.html">A/B testing</a>; very important if you want to try a few different value propositions or page designs.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0cdee5edd2241918de54_unbounce-1473265720487.png" alt="build landing page example"></div></figure><p>We’d highly recommend you start with a template; these have all been tested numerous times by Unbounce and their customers and they follow all the best practices of good conversion-oriented design. It’ll also save you time; remember this isn’t your proper website yet and you don’t have to stick with it forever!</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0cde1b776ee997f96425_unbounce_steps-1473265811041.png" alt="unbounce step by step guide"></div></figure><p>Look how easy that is! Just by double-clicking on the text you can edit it and change fonts, styling and anything else you need. You can also click and drag elements around the page or swap out the images for your own.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0cdee5edd2fd2218de55_color_palate-1473265800163.png" alt="color palate paletton example"></div></figure><p>One sticking point is usually colors. How do you know what to choose? The good news is that you have a window in the future to change these, if the idea does work out (but before you really launch the business), and you can test multiple styles in Unbounce. If you need a basic background in color theory, read this article, but don’t fret too much about it; it’s not really a ‘science’ as much of it has been debunked. To make sure your colors do ‘match’ each other, try and use a color matching site like Paletton.</p><p>You’ll also need some images. A common rookie mistake is to just take images directly from Google image search for your own use, which is illegal. You have to make sure the images are released by the artist for the purpose you intend to use them. I wouldn’t splash the cash on hiring a photographer to take snaps for you, instead start with a stock image that’s been released for companies to use. Here are some stock photo sites to try:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://stocksnap.io/">StockSnap</a> - free from copyright, no attribution required</li><li><a href="http://join.deathtothestockphoto.com/">Death to the Stock Photo</a> - email newsletter with unique pics</li><li><a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> - good for landscapes</li><li><a href="http://www.resplashed.com/">Resplashed</a> - free HD images</li><li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> - search millions of creative commons images</li><li><a href="http://startupstockphotos.com/">Startup Stock Photos</a> - photos of trendy startup offices</li><li><a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a> - lots of images and vectors</li></ul><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0cdebbb55108a7230deb_canva-1473265948267.png" alt="canva custom image example"></div></figure><p>Now how do you edit your images? If you don’t have photoshop or know how to use it, don’t fear! There are simple to use and free alternatives online. I’d start with <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> as they make it very simple with their good looking templates, but if you need something more advanced and similar to the photoshop experience, <a href="https://pixlr.com/editor/">Pixlr</a> is a good bet.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce0dc1058ddd0280e3d_pixlr-1473266104449.png" alt="pixlr photoshop alternative"></div></figure><p>OK, back to Unbounce. Remember the Minimum Viable Brand we worked out earlier? Well now is the time to put it to use. Each part of your MVB relates to the wording on each part of the landing page (I told you it was actionable!).</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce0b4573df0a56bea1d_minimum_viable_brand-1473266135511.png" alt="minimum viable brand copy example"></div></figure><p>You can see below how we’ve turned our MVB into actual copy on the page; if you can’t easily do this, it might be time to revisit your brand and rework it until it sounds right.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce011194a2b8a31251b_landing_page_progress-1473266170531.png" alt="landing page in progress"></div></figure><p><em>Note: remember to check how it looks on mobile, as the vast majority of people (~80%) who visit your page will experience it this way.

It makes it easy to simply copy and paste your Google Analytics tracking code and Facebook conversion pixel. If you need more information on how this is done, Google, Unbounce and Facebook all have excellent documentation.</p><p>The other cool thing you can do in Unbounce (that I highly recommend) is setting up a custom domain. For example if you own the domain www.example.com, you could send anyone who enters that into their browser to your Unbounce page. Don’t go buying too many domains early on however; you might want to wait till you’re really confident before you invest, particularly if they cost more than ~$20 (it’s astounding how much money I’ve wasted on unused domain names over the years).</p><h4><strong>Kickoff Labs</strong></h4><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce0f103951771fbb5ef_kickoff_labs-1473266315687.png" alt="kickoff labs finished landing page"></div></figure><p>One great way to get more users is to prompt ones that sign up to share with their friends after they sign up on your Unbounce page; a viral ‘thank you’ page. You’ve probably seen many examples already, or you might be familiar with the way Harry’s Razors launched with a viral waiting list. The good news is that you don’t have to build any custom websites or features for this either - <a href="https://app.kickofflabs.com/landing-page-templates">Kickoff Labs</a> has a version you can set up with no coding, which has a direct integration with Unbounce. They even have a template modeled on Harry’s Razors’ page!</p><h3><strong>Email Drip Campaign</strong></h3><p>Once people sign up and give you an email, they’ll expect to hear something from you. There a lot of different options out there, but Mailchimp is what we recommend as an easy way to send the people who sign up to your list a series of emails to keep them engaged.</p><p>At a bare minimum, make sure you have a welcome email; send them an email to say hi and give them a desired action to take next. If you want, you can even set up a series of follow up emails to keep them engaged; but I wouldn’t go this far until you see how your landing page works (if nobody even signs up in the first place, they won’t ever get to see your lovingly crafted drip campaigns!).</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce3b6c0242e851bebf9_mailchimp-1473266338516.png" alt="mailchimp how to "></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce19c0a23c7ef687e22_welcome_email-1473266356771.png" alt="welcome email mailchimp example"></div></figure><p>[leadform color_scheme=&quot;dark&quot; btn_color=&quot;red&quot; cta=&quot; Talk to a strategist&quot; heading=&quot;Stop guessing and start growing your business!

With even a $50 budget you can show an ad to thousands of people and have hundreds of clicks to your page. Don’t get hung up on the cost here; a small investment now will save you hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars pursuing the wrong ideas. Even better, this small amount of spend will usually give you an early read on whether your unit economics are off. If you’re expecting 10% of visitors to signup and you only get 5%, you have work to do!</p><p>We’ll walk through the <a href="facebook-ads.html">Facebook</a> and <a href="google-adwords.html">Google ad</a> platforms as they’re the ones you should start with. But first thing’s first; where do these ads show? Typically ads placed directly in line with the ‘organic’ results are the best performing. However, in some cases on desktop you can also appear on the right-hand side (these are cheaper, but get clicked on less). See examples below:</p><h4><strong>Facebook</strong></h4><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce1eb1a528a24ac0a5c_facebook_ads-1473361818971.png" alt="facebook ads"></div></figure><h3><strong>Google</strong></h3><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce11eecf36da9412460_google_adwords-1473266437928.png" alt="google adwords"></div></figure><p>The really cool thing about modern marketing is how well you can control who actually sees these ads; there are some pretty <a href="facebook-ads-faq.html">advanced targeting options</a> out there!</p><p>For example on Facebook, you can target by demographic.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce171f0f8a65c0e2152_facebook_targeting-1473266464623.png" alt="facebook targeting"></div></figure><p>You can target by what that person likes or has shown interest in (or exclude people who have certain interests).</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce1c8a171e816393cc4_interest_targeting-1473266493167.png" alt="interest targeting"></div></figure><p>There are even some really creepy behavioral options.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce2eb1a52b8eaac0a5d_behavioral_targeting-1473266511902.png" alt="behavioral targeting"></div></figure><p>Going further down the rabbithole, you can even use your own data to target users on Facebook; for example targeting people who have been on your website, have given you an email address, used your app or even engaged with your content on Facebook.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce211194a539b312529_custom_audiences-1473266541151.png" alt="custom audiences"></div></figure><p>Use <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/audience-insights">audience insights</a> to ensure that the audience you’re targeting is big enough, and use the <a href="http://www.jonloomer.com/2016/01/14/facebook-audience-overlap/">overlap tool</a> to so you’re not accidentally targeting the same people with multiple campaigns.</p><p>On Google, things are a little less creepy, though I definitely became a little bit more wary about what I searched for once I realized my searches were showing up in some digital marketer’s <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/6161567/The-20-funniest-suggestions-from-Google-Suggest.html">keyword report</a>!</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce2de5152750784af21_google_search_keywords-1473266599839.png" alt="google search keywords"></div></figure><p>Make sure to use the <a href="https://adwords.google.co.uk/KeywordPlanner">keyword planner</a> to research how many people actually search for the words you want to advertise against.</p><p>Remember your Minimum Viable Brand?

If you managed to work out your unit economics earlier on in this guide, you already have what you need! Just divide how much revenue you expect to make per click (or conversion) by how many conversion you expect to get, and that should be your bid.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce217963b840fb35ac2_cpc_bids-1473266724758.png" alt="cpc bids"></div></figure><p>Great, if you’ve gotten this far you’ve learned a lot! Time for a little bit more homework to put this into practice.

Wouldn’t it be great if you could get that traffic for free? That’s what I thought. If you’re happy so far with how your paid traffic is working out, you must be growing in confidence with your idea. Now is the time to start promoting it to influencers.</p><h3><strong>Finding Influencers</strong></h3><p>Just Google it! Seriously it’s sometimes just that easy. If they’re ranking highly for important terms to your business, they’re the type of people you want to work with to promote your idea.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce3924f22a2311f3482_google_influencers-1473266793364.png" alt="google influencers"></div></figure><p>Another way to find them is with a tool called <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/">BuzzSumo</a>.

Make sure you record the posts from the top people in your space as you can start posting these via your social profiles. What you want to end up with is something like the following spreadsheet.</p><p><strong>*Download the spreadsheet here: [</strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BlTqVuZHjQ-gzUbW9GtePF3e2HNg97UFDQNGKvWvLX0/edit#gid=0"><strong>Get the Template</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce36b2b3ab3aff0947e_influencer_spreadsheet-1473267019012.png" alt="influencer spreadsheet"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce3e3db9de0d52a0d5e_tweet_spreadsheet-1473267022132.png" alt="tweet spreadsheet"></div></figure><p>Now that you have this master sheet, you should set up profiles on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn (if B2B), then start posting.

If your new business idea has made it through all the previous steps, you really might be onto something. Let yourself get excited for five minutes. Then come back to reality; you still only have an idea… if you think ideas have value, try and sell your idea to someone. How do you turn that idea into a product?</p><p>DON’T power up Photoshop and start designing the product of your dreams. There’s one more lean step to take before you do that; creating a mockup.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce34b7189c6da6cb46e_balsamiq-1473267409317.png" alt="balsamiq mockups"></div></figure><p>Mockups are purposefully rough sketches of what you want your product to look like and how you want it to operate. Because they’re rough, they don’t take as long as a full fidelity design, and they are also less likely to distract people into giving biased feedback. For example they might say they like a product, when they really just like the colors you used. To create mockups I’ve used <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> for years, but there are lots of other great options.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce4dc105877ca280e48_mockup-1473267438310.png" alt="mockup example "></div></figure><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> you can actually make mockups clickable; that can go a long way to simulating how you actually want it to perform once the idea has been built.</p><h3><strong>Why Mockups?</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>Forcing yourself to define how your product will look, helps you realize the complexity and tradeoffs inherent in building your product</li><li>The final product will likely be completely different to your initial vision - you’d be crazy to commit too much time to Photoshop or coding</li><li>Low fidelity version leaves room for expert designers / developers to do their job, whilst still giving them solid direction</li></ul><p>Now that you have a mockup, it’s time for User Testing! This just means showing your mockup to potential users to get feedback. How do you do this? Well at a most basic level you could just print out your mockups and lay them out.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce4924f22a5821f3483_printed_mockups-1473267483681.png" alt="printed mockups marketing"></div></figure><p>At the high end, you can use a website like <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting</a>, who will find people in your target demographic and send you full screen and audio recordings of them using your product. However, for your purposes this is a little over the top; I’d stick to paper, or maybe try their <strong>free</strong> service, <a href="http://peek.usertesting.com/">Peek</a>, on your landing page to make sure it’s understandable to the general public.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce449ea715da77e74f0_usertesting_peek-1473267528832.png" alt="usertesting peek"></div></figure><h4>So what questions do you ask?</h4><ul role="list"><li>What is your first impression of this website / mobile app?</li><li>What is this page for?</li><li>What is the first thing you would like to do on this page?</li><li>Please go ahead and try that now.</li><li>(back to home screen) &gt; If you needed to do X, where would you go?</li><li>Please try to do X now.</li><li>What stood out about this website / mobile app?</li><li>What frustrated you about this website / mobile app?</li><li>How would you describe this website / mobile app to a friend?</li><li>Who would you recommend this website / mobile app to?</li></ul><p>Make sure you get them to talk aloud, reassure them that there are no wrong answers and make sure you record the session for later.</p><h4><strong>Why User Testing?</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li>It’s very likely you’re overestimating the average user’s knowledge</li><li>It’s also very likely you’re underestimating how complex your product is</li><li>User Testing gives you a reality check as to what real people think</li><li>You get a lot of qualitative data on what people struggle with, what they expect to see and the language they use to describe you</li><li>Running a couple of user tests can save you thousands in dev / design</li><li>You can get useful information from user testing even using wireframes</li><li>You can also run User Tests of your competitor’s websites!</li></ul><h3><strong>Press Release</strong></h3><p>Congrats, you’re at the final step (of the final step)! You’ve done a lot - much more than most - which is why you’re now much more likely to succeed. But there is one final step: the press release.</p><p>Jeff Bezos forces any new product at Amazon to first be pitched in the form of a <a href="https://www.quora.com/Amazon-company-What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management">press release</a>, before assigning budget to build it. He does that because it allows him to prioritize products that make sense to the market; if you can’t succinctly express the product in press release format, you probably have an overly complex idea. The other great thing about doing this is that you actually have a press release to send out once your product is actually released.</p><p>For example check out this press release for Amazon Web Services</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/610c0ce4d45bda107de2e855_amazon_web_services-1473267665126.png" alt="amazon web services"></div></figure><p><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=830816"><em>Source</em></a></p><p>See how clearly the strategy is laid out here?
