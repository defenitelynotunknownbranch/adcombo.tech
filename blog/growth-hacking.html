We make sure we add all these to the ideas to an ‘icebox’.</p><p>Based on our analysis and the business goal at hand, we <a href="growth-strategy.html">prioritize the top 10+ tactics</a> we find to be the most impactful for the coming month.

This involves pitching your three test ideas to the rest of the team, including at least one of the Ladder senior leadership team. As each tactic is pitched, the team pokes holes in the strategy, grills each other on the numbers, and offers their own tactic recommendations to replace those that didn’t pass.</p><p>Once we’re really confident that our recommendations are the right ones given what we know, we pitch them to the client. We usually try and arrange our weekly calls on Wednesdays so we can walk the client through our recommendations on the phone. However, they have access to our platform so they can follow along or look in more detail later.</p><p>Our clients will always know more about their business than we can, and they get a veto on each tactic (though we do try and change their minds if our logic is sound). If the client vetoes a tactic, we go back to the drawing board and decide on a replacement before the tactics are due to go live next week.</p><p><strong>Output:</strong> Client Approval.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef26368239a0bf3bd75ef5_ladder_marketing_test-1473706183160.png" alt="ladder marketing test"></div></figure><p><br><em>An example of a projected test in our platform.</em></p><h2>Execution</h2><p>Now we take all the hard work we did on strategy and make it work in practice.</p><p>Remember that we’re putting live tactics we decided on last week that passed ‘stress-testing’ and were approved by the client, so there aren’t usually any surprises. However the platforms we use to execute said tactics are constantly changing, and we sometimes what we wanted to do isn’t possible anymore. Sometimes we notice something new that would work even better.</p><p>In these cases, we might need to change what we planned, but these are usually small changes. If there’s a major issue, we might put the tactic in our ‘Icebox’ for future consideration.</p><p>Before putting anything live, we do a final run-through to check that we didn’t make any mistakes. We dig deep into a few aspects of the campaign to see if everything looks as expected. We get a colleague to lend us an extra pair of eyes and make sure we’re not missing anything. Then, when we’re satisfied, we ship it and let the client know it’s live.</p><p>Finally, at the end of any execution, we double check that everything is working as expected.</p><p><em>*NOTE: We now have an entire team dedicated to execution (another to strategy, another to analysis/reporting, another to optimization, and another to copywriting and design).</em></p><p><strong>Output:</strong> Executed Tactics.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef26363e7a25665fef61be_ladder_performance_marketing-1473706260767.png" alt="ladder performance marketing"></div></figure><p><br><em>An example of three executed tests being tracked in our platform.</em></p><h2>Ladder Learning Friday’s</h2><p>Everything we needed to do for our clients is done now. But that doesn’t mean we’re finished. Just like pro athletes, we need to set aside some time for training in order to stay at the top of our game.</p><p>Friday is when we exercise our minds; reading about the latest tactics, <a href="google-shopping-brainlabs.html">exploring platforms</a> we’re unsure how to use and working towards industry-recognized <a href="marketing-certifications.html">certificates</a>. We also hold a formal training session we call ‘Ladder Learning,’ where one member of the team presents on a topic they’ve mastered that others could benefit from.</p><p>Considering our workload and busy schedules, setting this time aside is tough but essential. When we’re too busy and skip this time investment, the quality and creativity of our tactic recommendations noticeably suffers for weeks after.</p><p>Friday is also when we catch up on all the administrative things we need to do to keep the business running. Each employee has a 1-2-1 with their manager where they discuss how the week went and what can be improved for next week. We have a company all-hands meeting, where Ladder’s leadership update the whole team on big wins, any issues we’ve spotted, and how our product is developing.</p><p>For a little fun and to incentivize creativity, we also hold our ‘<a href="test-of-the-month-july-2018.html">Test of the Month</a>’ competition; where whoever pitched the best test that week wins a $100 Amazon gift card and a mini trophy to display on their desk.</p><p><strong>Output:</strong> Professional Development.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef26369cf04ffc4a887503_ladder_growth_degree-1473706387525.png" alt="ladder growth degree"></div></figure><p><br><em>Our training curriculum, available at </em><a href="http://www.freegrowthdegree.com/"><em>FreeGrowthDegree.com</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>Optimization</h2><p>While our main focus is on finding new tactics to test, we’ll have a number of tests running at a time; some SEO or social media tests can take 3 months to conclude. Our clients also typically have other marketing campaigns running; things that we (or they) tested in the past that we keep running. For our larger clients, these ‘business as usual’ campaigns can make up a sizable amount of budget and can’t be ignored just because they’re not currently being tested.</p><p>To make sure our existing campaigns get enough love and attention, we set aside some time at the beginning of each day to do our ‘daily checks’.</p><p>Assuming nothing is amiss and things are performing as expected, we’re done on the optimization front. However, sometimes we need to adjust bids, budgets, or settings to get campaigns back on track.</p><p>Doing this every day, we start to notice patterns in performance; if a particular campaign or channel is degrading, we might then make it the focus of one or more of our tests in that week’s strategy session. For example, running a creative test is a surefire way to get an old campaign purring again.</p><p><strong>Output:</strong> Performance uplift.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef26376e0d859d81819dc2_marketing_optimization-1473706433841.png" alt="marketing optimization"></div></figure><h2>When Things Go Wrong</h2><p>Of course, it’s not always possible to follow this process. Delays happen, plans change, issues arise. We hold ourselves to this process wherever possible, but not at the expense of common sense.</p><p>If a test isn’t ready, we won’t just put it live because it’s Thursday. If we haven’t done enough analysis, we don’t just recommend any old tactic just for the sake of it.</p><p><strong>This process is designed to tolerate exceptions.</strong> That’s why we do the hard stuff (analysis &amp; strategy) up front and leave wiggle room at the end of the week in case execution takes longer than expected. Often these are one-off slip-ups. However, if we’re repeatedly failing to implement part of the process, it’s our best indication that there’s a problem that we need to investigate further.</p><p>Some examples of this:</p><ul role="list"><li>If we’re constantly delaying tests because the client hasn’t approved the creative, maybe the brand guidelines aren’t clear?</li><li>If we aren’t coming up with tactics on time, maybe we’re struggling with analysis paralysis?</li><li>If we’re having a hard time tracking and reporting on performance, maybe we don’t have the right analytics tools installed and <a href="event-tracking.html">properly set up</a>?</li></ul><p>It usually comes down to training; knowing the process is falling down for more than one week in a row indicates we need to spend extra time supporting that strategist till they can manage it themselves. Tracking how much a strategist is on top of this process is the main way we determine resourcing, promotion, and how we predict client churn.</p><h2>The Ladder Growth Process</h2><p>That’s all folks! There are of course other processes that work, some of which may work better for your specific business case. What you read was the growth process that we find works extremely well for us. Fully adopting this process was a real turning point for <a href="../index-18.htm?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=growth-hacking">Ladder</a>.</p><p>The month we adopted this growth process our client churn go down 25% and our margin jump up to 30% (before, we were actually losing money!). Yes, we actually made more money AND our clients were happier about it. Win, win.</p><p><strong>If you like our growth process… steal it!</strong></p><p>We certainly didn’t invent most of these concepts — we pieced things together based on what worked for us. We’re standing on the shoulders of giants such as <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/500startups/02-brian-balfour-hub-spot-final">Bryan Balfour</a>, <a href="http://andrewchen.co/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs/">Andrew Chen</a>, and <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Eric Ries</a>.</p><p>It’s only fair that we put our version out there for others to benefit from.</p><p>Feel free to adapt this growth process to your situation. If you don’t have the time, try splitting this into one-hour blocks and spread them throughout the week (and automate your analysis via <a href="https://try.ladder.io/spotlight/">Spotlight</a>). If your business gets no traffic on the weekend, try shifting everything forward so execution happens on a Monday or Tuesday. If doing weekly sprints is too fast for you, try and do this on a month-to-month basis. Whatever works best for you.</p><p>Good luck!<a href="../index-18.htm?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=growth-hacking" target="_blank"><strong></strong></a></p></div><div class="w-embed"></div><h3 class="tactic-cta left">Ladder powers strategy and performance solutions for fast-growing brands<br>‍<br><a href="https://ladderdigital.typeform.com/to/CKV0sP?experiment_version=premium-revamp#3zsppzwnbhyo1vuu1248v9" target="_blank" class="talk-to-strategist-inline-cta"><span class="h3-inline-cta">Talk to a strategist →</span></a></h3></div></div><div class="blog-sections sign-up"><div class="container blog cta"><h2 class="heading-4">Growth is a high velocity game.</h2><p class="paragraph-3">Sign up to our newsletter to stay up to date with all the latest movements in the field.</p><div class="newsletter small w-form"><form id="email-form" name="email-form" data-name="Email Form" action="https://ladder.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=9e512c30baee245f2b57bc45b&amp;amp;id=9d86f56367" method="post" class="sign-up-form" data-wf-page-id="60c8e0dd23d40e4a6dae4ca3" data-wf-element-id="e1befde6-d7f4-7251-2123-4e8b4c4e50cb"><input class="email-sign-up-form w-input" maxlength="256" name="email" data-name="Email" placeholder="Enter your email here..." type="email" id="email" required=""><input type="submit" data-wait="Please wait..." class="filled-in-button orange w-button" value="Join the list"></form><div class="success-message w-form-done"><div>🎉 Thank you!
