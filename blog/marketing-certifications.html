With measurability comes accountability. Accountability leads to a meritocracy, where the best rise to the top regardless of how good they look in a suit.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef2ca512b1836fd787ff40_MAD_MEN16-1470352718631.jpeg" alt="don draper"></div></figure><p>I hear complaints from fellow entrepreneurs and hiring managers all the time – they say it’s getting almost as difficult to find good marketers as it is to find good developers.</p><p>I think the problem is actually worse with marketing. Unlike software development, where most unqualified people have the decency to give up or go to bootcamps to brush up on their skills, marketers have no shame. They will apply for literally any job, no matter how unqualified.</p><p>But say you wanted to get “qualified” …what would you do?</p><p>There’s no equivalent of a medical board, CFA qualification, or the bar exam for marketing. Most of the top people in marketing don’t have a marketing degree (shocking, right?). New techniques come out every week and old ones stop working (radio ads, anyone?). Online courses are more up to date and relevant, but there are thousands to choose from. It seems like these days every half-baked platform is offering a certification as a shady marketing ploy.</p><p>The tough question to answer, then, is this: <a href="digital-marketing-certifications.html">Which certifications are the good ones? What certifications should you get to land that marketing job</a>?</p><p>There’s no good answer, but in Ladder we’ve hired dozens of marketers in the past few years, so I’ll give you my answer. These are the marketing certifications we look for on the resumes of prospective marketing hires:</p><h2><strong>1) GoogleAds Search Certification</strong></h2><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef2ca5d4f2f65e06a5c800_Google-Ads-Search-Marketing-Certification.png" alt="Google Ads Search Marketing Certification"></div></figure><p>I don’t care if you never run any paid advertising. This course will teach you how to think about marketing. You’ll learn how to find out what people are searching for, <a href="ad-copy.html">how to write good ad copy</a>, how A/B testing works, and <a href="url-builder.html">how to track and report on performance</a>.</p><p>I get excited when I see this on your resume. I’d trust a marketer who understands <a href="intro-to-google-adwords.html">Google Ads</a> with any other marketing channel because they are noticeably better at systematic thinking. This course was mandatory in the first job of one of our co-founders: you got fired if you didn’t pass in the first 90 days. That company got acquired by Adobe for $350m.</p><p>Estimated time to acquire: 4-5h</p><p>Price: Free<br><a href="https://support.google.com/partners/answer/3154326?hl=en">&gt;&gt; Learn more</a></p><h2><strong>2) Google Analytics Individual Qualification</strong></h2><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef2ca61fd9cdf840722068_Professional-Marketing-Certification-Google-Analytics.png" alt="Professional Marketing Certification - Google Analytics"></div></figure><p>This marketing certification will help you get promoted. Seriously. Once you know how things are performing, you can do more of the good stuff, and less of the bad stuff. Then tell your boss (who doesn’t know how to use <a href="url-builder.html">Google Analytics</a>) about all the awesome stuff you did, with a big fat dollar amount next to it. Knowledge is power.</p><p>This course gets pretty technical. Most marketers aren’t. If you have this qualification, I immediately respect you. Unfortunately, you’ll have to get used to everyone pestering you to pull reports for them because they don’t know how. A good way to make friends and influence people.</p><p>Estimated time to acquire: 4-5h</p><p>Price: Free</p><p><a href="https://support.google.com/partners/answer/6089738?hl=en">&gt;&gt; Learn more</a></p><h2><strong>3) Growth Marketing Minidegree – CXL Institute</strong></h2><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef2ca6645bb45335903bc0_CXL-growth-marketing-certification.png" alt="CXL growth marketing certification"></div></figure><p><strong> </strong></p><p>This is probably the most well-rounded growth marketing certificate you can obtain on the Internet. </p><p>The range of topics is incredibly broad and includes courses like creating a <a href="marketing-plan.html">marketing plan</a> and a <a href="growth-strategy.html">growth process &amp; strategy</a>, through channel-specific topics like Facebook, Google, and Linkedin ads, while also teaching you the basics of CRO &amp; A/B testing.</p><p>We strongly recommend all Ladder’s specialists to take this certificate. All of the courses, that need to be passed to acquire this certificate are taught by the experts in a certain field, which makes it great to develop your skills – even if you think you possess advanced knowledge in a certain topic.</p><p>Be aware tho, that acquiring this certificate is no joke. You’ll have to be ready to commit more than 120 hours to pass it, with a test consisting of 75 demanding questions at the end. Only for serious players.</p><p>Estimated time to acquire: 120-150h</p><p>Price: $990 upfront, or from $289 a month</p><p><a href="https://cxl.com/institute/programs/growth-marketing-training?utm_source=ladder.io">&gt;&gt; Learn more</a></p><h2><strong>4) Hubspot Inbound </strong></h2><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef2ca6a29c9830e99be215_Inbound-Certification.png" alt="Hubspot Inbound Certification"></div></figure><p>Why chase your customers, when you can make them come to you? That’s a powerful concept. HubSpot pioneered ‘Inbound marketing’, and they’re worth $1.88 billion, so it’s worth listening to them. Blogging, Social Media, Landing pages and Email: this is what a well-rounded education looks like.</p><p>This is definitely a much easier course than Adwords and Analytics, but that doesn’t make it any less valuable. This is the most practically applicable course because you don’t need any money to do Inbound marketing. Perfect for marketers on small budgets.</p><p>Estimated time to acquire certificate: 2-3h</p><p>Price: Free</p><p><a href="https://certification.hubspot.com/inbound-certification">&gt;&gt; Learn more</a></p><h2><strong>5) Facebook Blueprint</strong></h2><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef2ca6b39a8f6a5c6758bb_Facebook-blueprint-certification.png" alt="Facebook blueprint certification"></div></figure><p>The one thing about growing a company through inbound… it’s slow. The fastest way? <a href="facebook-ads.html">Facebook ads</a>. Start by reaching thousands of people for a couple bucks and only scale it up if it works for you. The sky is the limit; over 1.73 billion people use Facebook daily – and the whole Facebook advertising ecosystem (that consists of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) is used by more than 3 billion users around the globe.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/blueprint"><br></a></p><p>The amazing thing about Facebook Ads is the ability to learn quickly, thanks to its advanced machine learning algorithms. You can test exactly what audiences (the targeting is super creepy by the way), value propositions and creative designs work the best. Even better, with all the extra traffic you’re driving, you can speed up learning on conversion, referral and retention tests too.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/blueprint"><br></a></p><p>Estimated time to acquire certificate: 4-8h</p><p>Price: free</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/blueprint">&gt;&gt; Learn more</a></p><h2><strong>6) Infinite Skills Excel</strong></h2><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef2ca599d549a6e3013aa6_Screen_Shot_2016_08_05_at_00_22_35-1470370985155.png" alt="excel tutorial"></div></figure><p>One day you’ll come to realize that the World is run by people in suits using Microsoft Excel. Be one of those people and you too can rule the World. Seriously, something like 95% of the ‘advanced analysis’ I’ve done has been in Excel and it’s crucial for building campaigns too.</p><p>This is so important that we force everyone who applies to work at <a href="../index.htm">Ladder</a> to complete a 1-hour excel test before they even qualify for an interview. That test has an 85% failure rate (even among more senior marketers). VLOOKUP and Pivot Tables are your new best friends, get acquainted.</p><p>Estimated time to acquire certificate: 8-10h</p><p>Price: $49.99</p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/advanced-excel/">&gt;&gt; Learn more</a></p><p><em>Pro Tip: Don’t want to pay for this course, but do want to hone your Excel skills?

Plus being able to code is just cool.</p><p>If you’re working in marketing space, the best way for you to start would be probably a course created by Ladder.io co-founder, and Ex COO, Michael Taylor. He’s an amazing marketing data analyst and Python practitioner. </p><p>The whole course curriculum was created specifically for digital marketers’ needs, to help you automate and replace Excel almost entirely while giving you a headstart into the world of coding.</p><p>Estimated time to acquire certificate: 7-12h</p><p>Price: $99 or $49.50 with special code for Ladder readers “LADDER”</p><p><a href="https://www.pythonformarketers.com/p/replace-excel/?coupon_code=LADDER">&gt;&gt; Learn more</a></p><h2><strong>8) Reforge – Growth Series</strong></h2><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef2ca688e6d6566fac1319_Reforge-Growth-Certification.png" alt="Reforge Growth Certification"></div></figure><p>Brian Balfour: ex-VP of Growth @ Hubspot</p><p>Andrew Chen: ex-Growth @ Uber</p><p>Bangaly Kaba: ex-Head of Growth @ Instagram</p><p>These are only few names of people involved in creating the Reforge program.

The curriculum includes acquisition, referral &amp; retention, growth models, user psychology &amp; experiments. After finishing it, you should be able to implement a complete growth process into your organization.</p><p>However, be aware that this is a closed program.

Our entire team is deeply ingrained into the Startup Institute ecosystem, and we’re slowly doing the same with General Assembly.</p><p>Why?</p><p>A few reasons:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Willingness to take risks</strong> – quitting your job to go back to get educated on the skills needed for a modern digital workplace shows the kind of gutsy behavior we value at Ladder.</li><li><strong>Making a big bet on themselves</strong> – many students of SI and GA are career changers. They were previously working at large corporations, financial institutions, or industries they didn’t want to be in. They took a big bet by taking on further education to pivot their careers.</li><li><strong>Practical experience</strong> – SI and GA allow students to get into the weeds with actual companies and actual projects, letting them learn how to run ads, create landing pages, run conversion tests, etc…</li></ul><p>This doesn’t just apply to Startup Institute and General Assembly, but to all <a href="https://www.growthmentor.com/blog/growth-marketing-bootcamps/">bootcamps that focus on training people</a> for the type of environment we thrive in.

It’s the single unifying tool that enables us to use a bunch of different portions of our <a href="marketing-stack.html">marketing tech stack</a> without having to manually change website code.</p><p>Google Tag Manager (GTM) allows you to add all the different scripts and tags needed for things like Google Ads conversion tracking, Facebook Pixels, tools like VWO, and much, much more. All of this is done with just a single script added to a website, enabling you to easily add and run all other tags via GTM’s user interface.</p><p>Any candidate that has gone through the Google Tag Manager Fundamentals course immediately signals that they understand the need for optimizing the way tech and advertising tools are implemented onto a website. They’ve learned how to use GTM and gone through examples on setting up tools and scripts with Tag Manager. That’s one bit of training that helps immensely during our onboarding week.</p><p>If you want to become a more technical marketer, without learning code, this is a professional marketing certificate you should definitely start with.</p><p>Estimated time to acquire certificate: 4-6h</p><p>Price: Free</p><p><a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/5/faqs">&gt;&gt; Learn more</a></p><h2><strong>13) Digital Marketer – Customer Value Optimization</strong></h2><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef2ca781106757790658af_Customer-Value-Optimization-Digital-Certificate.png" alt="Customer Value Optimization Digital Certificate"></div></figure><p>Thinking in terms of funnels and value-optimization is the key to creating a successful growth strategy in 2020.
