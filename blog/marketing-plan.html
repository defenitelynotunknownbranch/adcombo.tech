They <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=marketing+plan">Google “Marketing Plan”</a> and get a list of contrived, theoretical, impractical templates.</p><p>Very few businesses are willing to be <a href="https://open.buffer.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/">transparent</a> about what’s working for them, for fear of giving competitors an upper hand. After all the old adage says <a href="https://suntzublog.wordpress.com/2009/12/17/all-warfare-is-based-upon-deception/">all warfare is based on deception</a>.</p><p>If you read our blog, you know our thinking isn’t outdated. However, NDAs with our clients stop us from sharing any of the 30+ marketing plans we generate every month as examples (you can, however, <a href="https://blog.ladder.io/tag/test-of-the-month/">see the results</a>).</p><p>I’ve <a href="https://chatbotsmagazine.com/marketing-plan-and-chill-75f7e3d63358">tackled this issue before</a>, but that was built entirely from publicly available information. To do this right, I needed a business willing to share all of its confidential marketing data.</p><p>Eventually, we had a brainwave: <strong>why not open-source our own marketing plan?</strong></p><p>At $5k per month budgeted plus a full-time marketer on the books, we were big enough to actually be a client of our own agency. #meta</p><p>You’re reading that plan.</p><p>…but it gets better.</p><p>If we just stopped there, we’d already be providing some of the most useful content out there on how to create a marketing plan.

The best marketing plan template. The best marketing plan example.</p><p>The good news is you don’t have to use our technology to follow along… we’ll walk you through how to replicate everything yourself with free/cheap tools (<a href="marketing-stack.html">see all 55 marketing tools we use to grow startups</a>).<br></p><p>So let’s get started.</p><h2>Your Marketing Plan Template User Guide</h2><p>This marketing plan example is a BEAST. At 37,500+ words spread across 9 different blog posts, it took us more than 100 hours to put it together. <strong><em>Bookmark this post and treat it as a table of contents</em></strong>. As we walk you through how to create a marketing plan, we’ll link out to relevant blog posts where it explains how we did the bulk of the work.</p><p>Don’t feel like you have to read everything or follow along with the whole process religiously. Unless you’re starting from scratch you’ve probably already done pieces of this. For example, the first few sections, in particular, can be abandoned if your marketing plan is for internal use and your brand is already well established.</p><p>You should also expect 6 out of 7 of the tests in your marketing plan to fail. This doesn’t mean planning is a waste of time; thanks to proper planning <a href="growth-marketing.html">our success rate is 300% above average</a>. You’ll notice that over <a href="marketing-audit.html">75% of this marketing plan relates to research or auditing</a>before you get to writing the actual ‘plan’ at the end. This is intentional; the more of this you do, the higher your success rate.</p><p>Finally, if you start reading this marketing plan template and get overwhelmed; don’t worry. It took millions of dollars and thousands of hours to build this expertise. If it was easy, it wouldn’t be <a href="https://blog.ladder.io/A/B Testing/">a valuable skill</a>. If you’re interested in getting us to do it for you, sign up to talk to a strategist on <a href="../index-1.htm?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=marketing-plan">our website</a>.

Defining our <a href="https://ladder.io/tactic/Product-Positioning-Ad-Copy">positioning</a> gives us the context needed to make strategic decisions. It’s vitally important to build a shared vision of our history, present and past that’s written down and agreed at the highest levels.</p><p>These pieces might at first glance seem ‘fluffy’ or useless – I certainly thought so when I was first starting out in marketing. However they’re actually highly functional; in fact, it can be very difficult to do your job as a marketer without these building blocksin place.</p><p>The ‘elevator pitch’ and ‘blurb’ translates into website copy; our style guide helps us stay on brand with our ads; analysis of our unit economics gives us an idea of what we can afford to acquire a customer. More importantly, these documents serve as a reference point for everyone who touches marketing, employees, freelancers, vendors, on exactly the same page.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>History</strong> (<a href="marketing-strategy.html#industry">industry trends</a>, <a href="marketing-strategy.html#team">team bios</a>, <a href="marketing-strategy.html#founding">founding story</a>, <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/ladder">Indie Hackers profile</a>)</li><li><strong>Brand</strong> (<a href="marketing-strategy.html#pitch">elevator pitch</a>, <a href="marketing-strategy.html#blurb">company blurb</a>, <a href="brand-guide.html">brand styleguide</a>, <a href="marketing-strategy.html#soco">SOCO/SOCA</a>, <a href="marketing-strategy.html#basic">tagline</a>, <a href="marketing-strategy.html#basic">takeaway</a>, <a href="marketing-strategy.html#persona">persona</a>)</li><li><strong>Strategy</strong> (<a href="marketing-strategy.html#mission">mission</a>, <a href="marketing-strategy.html#lean-canvas">lean canvas</a>, <a href="marketing-strategy.html#competitors">competitors</a>, <a href="marketing-strategy.html#swot">SWOT</a>)</li></ul><h2>Market Research</h2><p>The next step in our marketing plan example is to explore what’s possible in the current market. If we can build a picture of what audiences are possible to target, what value propositions our competitors are using and the influencers that might impact our persona’s decision to work with us, we can come up with a lot of ideas for potential marketing campaigns we should be running.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Audiences</strong> <a href="target-audience.html">audience</a>, <a href="google-adwords.html">keywords</a></li><li><strong>Competitors</strong> <a href="market-research.html">competitor propositions</a></li><li><strong>Influencers</strong> <a href="market-research.html">influencers</a></li></ul><h3>Marketing Audits</h3><p>Up until now, almost everything we’ve done has been with publicly available information; it’s essentially similar to what I did in <a href="and-chill.html">Marketing Plan And Chill</a>. However, we don’t have to stop here. We’re in the fortunate position of actually having marketing activity running, and we’re willing to share everything with you!

First, we check out our analytics; is this accurate enough for us to <a href="statistical-significance.html">confidently report on performance</a>? Next, we tackle the UX (user experience) and what happens in terms of CRM when you sign up. We then focus on SEO (“Are we doing anything stupid to harm our organic search traffic?”).

We were using Google Tag Manager, firing useful events, and nothing weird was going on with our traffic. A couple of misfiring events were found and we explored our advanced setup for connecting marketing and sales.</p><h4>Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)</h4><p>The <a href="marketing-analysis.html">conversion journey is incredibly important to optimize</a>because it makes every single one of your marketing channels perform better.

But once you do put in the hard work and effort necessary, organic search can be a sustainable source of traffic you don’t have to pay for.</p><p>Mostly this involved looking at the technical setup of our website to make sure we weren’t doing anything stupid (spoiler: we were).

Also that our meta titles and descriptions needed work, and we need to build more links.</p><h4>Pay Per Click Advertising (<a href="https://blog.ladder.io/category/ppc/">PPC</a>)</h4><p>Google Adwords / Facebook Ads are an important area to focus on, because it’s where a lot of our budget is spent. Any changes can immediately save us money or <a href="lead-generation-faq.html">drive more leads</a>.</p><p>Because these platforms are so measurable, you have a lot more data to help you decide your strategy. We can see exactly what keywords, adverts and other factors performed best.</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="ppc-audit.html">We Audited Our PPC Ad Campaigns. Here’s What We Learned</a></li></ul><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef26744f5e1a8d55c551d6_ppc_audit_banner-1480960105759.png" alt="ladder ppc audit"></div></figure><p><em>Summary:</em> We found a number of quick wins to put in place, and came up with plenty of ideas to test in the next few months. Our creative needs more diversity and testing, but largely our account is in pretty good shape and we have lots of room for expansion.</p><h2>Writing The Marketing Plan</h2><p>Finally, this is the part where we pull everything together. We have researched every opportunity, <a href="https://try.ladder.io/spotlight/">audited every account</a> and found all the issues on our website. As we’ve walked through each audit and research piece, we’ve been jotting down ideas for tests. Our job now is to <a href="growth-strategy.html">prioritize them into a meaningful plan</a> focused on growing faster for less resource.</p><h3>Tracking Plan</h3><p>First, before we jump into the tactics, we need to make sure we have the right tools for the job. We noticed a few different issues with our tracking setup when we audited it, but nothing major. That’s not normally the case for our clients; we typically need to write them a full tracking plan.</p><p>To give you an idea of what that looks like we decided to write a plan around installing Segment, a more advanced tag management tool. Because they have direct integrations with lots of analytics (and other) platforms, it sets us up to work with any vendor we want to in the future.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14GrTCY6XEJNtUg5LpdptmJ59HUfboRWmtGIWm6WZrS0/edit#gid=0">See our tracking plan</a></p><h3>Tactic Backlog</h3><p>Here it is: <a href="../playbook.html">the master list of 1000+ ideas</a> we generated from all those hours researching and auditing our accounts. After a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2lJhRF8zpsu3CyFIm2A7oH9vCGwk7DCl3y-e8QFGtA/edit#gid=0">brainstorming session</a> we got to over 100 tactics in total! The majority are to get more traffic, which makes sense for a small new business looking to grow.</p><p>Now we prioritize these tactics by choosing the top ones to test based on our experience. Some people use more formal methods of rating by impact vs cost, <a href="growth-strategy.html">but I’ve always found those values arbitrary</a>; you make up the numbers to represent the priority you wanted in the first place.</p><p><em>Summary:</em> We came away with almost 40 new audiences to test on PPC, over 20 SEO tactics and 10 more ideas for blog posts. We have a small amount of impactful CRO tests that would make a big difference, and a couple of more zany ideas, like a Ladder slots machine widget.</p><h3>Month 1 Marketing Plan Example</h3><p>This is the part you’ve all been waiting for; the final marketing plan example for our first month. We rarely plan further ahead than one month, because as we start to get data from these tests we learn more about what’s working, what isn’t and what new tactics we could try because of it.</p><p>Every month we dig into what tactics failed, and come up with new tests based on those learnings, to test next month; every time getting smarter about what we pick. Remember that 80%-90% of marketing experiments fail. All this research will have improved our odds, but we expect to be wrong more than we’re right.</p><p>These are 12 tactics we chose to run in 2017:</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef240f94741124178b8508_12-tactics-1.png" alt="12 tactics"></div></figure><p>Why 12? Well, after a lot of testing at Ladder we’ve found a sweet spot at the 12 tactic mark, for a business our size. For some of our larger customers, we test more than 12 tactics, and for some of our smaller ones focusing on one channel, we test less, but 12 gets the best results.</p><p>Here’s a quick explanation in the form of hypotheses for each tactic:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Emoji vs. No Emoji Subject Lines</strong>: We’re not yet sure whether emojis in subject lines actually work well with our newsletter audience, so this test will determine that (via Mailchimp A/B testing of subject lines).</li><li><strong>Homepage SEO – Meta Title + Description</strong>: The idea for this tactic is that we had some wonky SEO problems on the homepage and playbook that needed fixing. This tactic is designed to help us better capture some long tail keywords we use in the Playbook and to have a more relevant meta description in Google searches.</li><li><strong>Hero Copy – Current vs. New Meta Description</strong>“: We’re writing out a new meta description for Google search results for Ladder.io. Let’s test whether that copy change will drive higher conversion rates on our landing page if we place it as the hero copy. Testing it vs the current version via Google Optimize.</li><li><strong>Scroll Box + List Builder Copy</strong>: Our SumoMe Scroll Box + List Builder copy needs a refresh. Let’s test a different approach at gathering emails with the popups across the blog and Ladder.io homepage against what’s currently running. Goal: 10% increase in conversions w/ new copy.</li><li><strong>Port AdWords Campaigns to Bing</strong>: Our AdWords campaign perform well, so we should try to expand them over to a new ad platform – Bing. It’s easy to do – just import directly to Bing with one click. We’ll be using 20% of our AdWords daily cap as budget here as Bing gets 1/5 of the traffic Google does.</li><li><strong>Playbook SEO – Image + Description Tags</strong>: The idea for this tactic is that we had some wonky SEO problems on the homepage and playbook that needed fixing. This tactic is designed to help us better capture some long tail keywords we use in the Playbook and to have a more relevant meta description and image alt tags in Google searches.</li><li><strong>Quuu Content Promotion</strong>: We have 10 remaining Quuu Promote credits that we can use to drive traffic to different Ladder blog posts, social posts, etc… If we get at least 50 sessions per credit used, then Quuu will be worth exploring further.</li><li><strong>Marketing Strategy Landing Page</strong>: Currently, our top-performing AdWords keyword is Marketing Strategy. Our ads lead people straight to the Ladder homepage, but we might get better performance with a more relevant landing page that’s specific to the keyword. If we get a higher CTR and CVR at a lower CPA than the original, we’ll know that the LP is effective and a better alternative to ladder.io.</li><li><strong>Accelerator Interest Audience</strong>: Accelerator interest has worked well in growing Instagram via Instagress. Let’s try running actual ads on this audience in Facebook in the UK &amp; US. If we can get 30 leads at a $30 cost per, we know this audience is worthwhile.</li><li><strong>LinkedIn Startup Founder/CEO Audience</strong>: We’re testing out LinkedIn as a platform, and since most of our current clients are startups, targeting founders and C-level marketing execs is a good first stab at a LinkedIn audience. We should get 5 leads at $50 CPA for this test to be successful. We’ll run this test for 2 weeks.</li><li><strong>“ROI-Driven” Vs “Data-Driven” Ad Copy</strong>: “Everybody is data-driven. That means nothing these days. Ladder is ROI-driven.” – common statement around the office. SO! Let’s see if ROI-driven actually performs well with our audience. We’ll test the two copy approaches against one another with the same audience, and we’ll run it on Facebook. We’ll go for 10 conversions at a $50 cost per, and run the test for 4 weeks. If ROI-driven beats Data-Driven, we’ll know if we’re on to something.</li><li><strong>B2B Marketing AdWords Keyword</strong>: We’re getting lots of B2B and SaaS leads and clients, and should try to run some ads on the B2B marketing keyword to see if we can reach this targeted audience.</li></ul><h2>Ladder Planner, Playbook, &amp; Spotlight</h2><p>Up until this point, I’ve been walking you through how to do this yourself. So far we’ve used no specialized tools other than off-the-shelf ones that are provided free via the advertising platforms or are cheap to buy.</p><p>However, we’re about to get into the execution &amp; performance updates, and when we walk you through what we’re doing you’ll notice something different – our technology.
