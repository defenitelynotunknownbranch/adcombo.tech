And this isn’t just monetary ROI. This is about ROI time and energy for your company. Quick side note: we’ll have some time for Q&amp;A towards the end. Feel free to use the Q&amp;A box as we go. If something pops into your head, drop us a question and we’ll make sure to get to that towards the end. And make sure to stick around as we’re going to have something special for everyone who makes it towards the end. Just a little-added bonus for you. Brody, want to take us in?</p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> Yeah, let’s do it. First, I’m really happy everyone’s listening in today and to those who will be listening in the future. This is, in my opinion, the most important topic that’s transformed Ladder’s own growth. Everything that we talk about today has one purpose: it’s to actionably and quickly transform the amount of MRR in revenue your company can generate every month, through simple, step-by-step tactics–that we’ll get into–that will supercharge the way your company currently treats growth, and I think that’s–at a more philosophical level, a really important thing to take away today. Marketing and sales should have one purpose and that’s growth, and what defines growth really cleanly growth is when your company generates more capital and more revenue.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Alright, that sound perfect. Well, my name is Mike, I’ll be one of your co-hosts here today. I’m the new business strategist here at Ladder. I’ve spent almost a decade in marketing in most conceivable roles, from graphic designer, manager, director, instructor, you name it, chances are good that I’ve done it within a marketing department. I’ve been holding down the fort here in Austin, Texas, working with business owners to understand the challenges they’re facing, the goals they’re seeking to achieve, and working with them to show how Ladder can help them get there through <a href="scientific-marketing.html">our scientific approach to marketing</a>. Our other host is Jon Brody, our CEO. Jon, I’ll let you take it away.</p><p><strong>Jon: </strong>Yep, so Ladder is my third company. In my previous two startups, I was responsible for growing them and the best context I can give you right now is that Ladder grew to over a quarter million dollars of MRR as an organization, with a sales teams that was never larger than two. The only way we were able to do that is by how efficient our marketing and sales teams ran. The webinar today is actually tracing back how we gained that efficiency, how we became that level when it came to our MRR and our growth, and the tactics that we chose to change the way we ran our company from a more traditional approach when it came to marketing and sales, to a more cutting-edge approach.</p><h2><strong>The Tug-of-War Between Marketing and Sales</strong></h2><p>It really starts with the fact that marketing and sales most often operate like they’re in a tug-of-war. There are three things that we’re going to go through today that will take you from point A–which is the traditional way of running your growth, where you have marketing and sales teams operating in silos–to a whole brand-new way of thinking about how you run your organization when it comes to growth, and the transformation that happens when marketing and sales actually align around one magic metric.</p><p>The first thing that we’ll get into is exactly what that magic metric should be. There’s a shockingly low amount of companies who actually run their growth using this metric. However, the ones that do instantly start seeing the rewards of greater efficiency and much greater output of marketing and sales when it comes to new MRR creation. </p><p>The second thing we’re going to get into is when it comes to lead scoring. Lead scoring is something that everyone knows is important. That said, even companies who do lead scoring, it’s often done in such a way that is causing more problems than it actually solves. The reason for that is, lead scoring, when done the traditional way, is a very manual, human error-prone process, where you have salespeople retroactively and manually try to score leads that marketing is generating. That, then, creates a lot of inefficiencies, it creates more distrust on the marketing side, you suddenly have to have marketing and sales people in meetings just to discuss, “Why was this lead qualified? Why wasn’t this lead qualified?” All of that creates delays. That then makes it difficult for marketing to maximize all of their outputs around spending all of their time generating truly qualified leads. Today, I’m going to show you how you can build a fully automated, transparent, and measurable system when it comes to lead scoring, that unites marketing and sales together.</p><p>The third part of the webinar today is going back into that; we’ll show you actual tactics, using Ladder as an example, and we’re open to questions at the end about how these tactics can be implemented in your environment. We’ll walk you through, step-by-step, how Ladder went from running its organization and growth traditionally to a more cutting-edge fashion, where we aligned around that magic metric, we automated our lead scoring, and our growth took off almost overnight once we did that.</p><h2><strong>A “Leaky&quot; Marketing and Sales Funnel</strong></h2><p>Before we get into that though, and we show you what that magic metric is, let’s look at what a “leaky” marketing and sales funnel looks like. This is probably how yours currently runs. One thing you’ll notice right off the bat is that everything is in silos. You have marketing focused on generating leads, handing those leads off to sales too frequently, in terms of how unqualified they end up being. You then have sales spending more their time not actually selling. You look at sales organizations, there are dedicated roles just to chase down qualified leads to book meetings with them. That’s highly inefficient. More than that, you have your salespeople spending time, talking to unqualified prospects, then spending their time talking to marketing about why someone wasn’t qualified. All of that leads to gross inefficiency and that is no optimizing towards growth. When you define growth in the way Ladder recommends you do, which is simply more MRR each month, you’re basically reducing your potential when it comes to MRR generation and revenue the way you’re currently running your organization through this siloed approach. </p><p>The solution, however, is when you align around what we call the True North Metric. It’s that one magic metric that optimizes everything marketing and sales does towards it. It creates proper alignment–as we’ll shortly get into–and this is a much different approach to one that relies more on guesswork. When marketing generates lots of leads and then gets handed off to a sales-based silo, where sales is trying to close them, but they often spend more time talking to unqualified leads, they spend more time trying to lead score, they spend more time talking to marketing about why things and why prospects weren’t qualified or not–all that creates inefficiency, it creates that tug-of-war level of distrust that brings everyone who works for your company on the marketing and sales side further away from actually giving you more growth.</p><p>And the number one way you start solving that is through alignment and that is that True North metric. And the magic way of solving it is by making it qualified meetings booked per month. Now next up, we’ll show you two ingredients that go into a winning B2B strategy but this should sit at the very top. Everything you should be focusing on when it comes to marketing and sales is how many meetings did you book in calendar per month. When you’re successfully doing this, two things happen. One, your sales teams spends a majority of time actually selling. Your marketing team spends a majority of their time actually getting a proper feedback loop on what’s a good lead and what’s not a good lead, and focusing all-in and doubling down on the winning channels and tactics that are leading to more qualified meetings booked every single month.  Very important to note that this magic metric means that your sales team shouldn’t have to chase down leads. If you do this right, you can actually build your organization, especially as a startup or SMB that can get to a pretty good scale, at least to the scale of Ladder, where you’re around $250-$300K MRR and not have to have dedicated reps just trying to chase down leads and hoping they book in calendars.</p><h2><strong>The Magic Metric and A Winning B2B Growth Strategy </strong></h2><p>The very first ingredient here, of course, goes back to qualified leads. You still need qualified leads in order to optimize towards that magic metric. The way that we’ll solve this, and we’ll show you in a bit, is how you automate lead scoring through on-site workflow that marketing can take a lot of responsibility for. That helps you start defining measurably how many qualified leads you’re getting each and every month.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> So Jon, the one thing–I want to make a side note here that stands out, especially on this side, looking at minimally viable qualified leads, which is tough to say but really important. Looking at things like scoring on revenue per month, number of team members, job title, etc. What this sounds like to me is the opportunity to start validating your buyer’s personas. Most companies have their buyer’s personas built out for their particular company. If they don’t, they ought to. But what I see most times with a buyer’s persona is that they get created in the beginning and it gets stuck on the shelf and nobody bothers with it anymore. So what I’m seeing here, and this is a good little side note to have, is this is an opportunity to validate those buyers personas, see if you need to reassess who you’re going after or who you’re pursuing a clients, and using that to really focus in and really start moving towards that True North Metric that we’re looking at. Is that correct?</p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> Yeah, that’s precisely it. What you want to have happen, when you have that feedback loop between sales and marketing isn’t a “Hey, this lead wasn’t qualified. Stop giving us these bad leads.” It’s actually should be, “Hey, the lead scoring that we agreed to and we set up and running in autonomous fashion is wrong. We’ve actually now seen that what we thought was a qualified lead actually isn’t. Let’s change that one input in the lead scoring system and see what happens next.” That, again, goes back to having less friction in how marketing and sales works together and it also allows you to treat your growth more like an actual science.</p><p>And right here we see a sheet–this is Ladder’s own actually, that shows the cost per actual lead. This should be one of the outputs that marketing can deliver to you almost immediately when you implement that tactics we’re going to show you when it comes to having lead scoring happen in an automated way through your conversion workflow. This allows marketing to immediately double-down all their focus on the channels actually driving value. That makes marketers really happy and salespeople really happy. And again, going back to that magic metric of qualified meetings being booked each month, doing this is one of the ways to get qualified leads into the system.     </p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Oh definitely, and looking at this, being able to look at this and take a broad view of your channels as well and getting a better sense of how they align with your overall sales and marketing goals helps you, again like you said, take a more scientific approach to this. It becomes less about what you believe–preconceived notions and more about that actual numbers themselves. Take LinkedIn and Quora here. LinkedIn and Quora is a good example. You can see the number of leads we got on both is relatively small. You have three and three–three lead per channel here. You can see the conversion rate substantially higher on Quora. LinkedIn is known for having a really high cost per click, a really high acquisition cost, but if you can move it one over to the left to the next column here on the sheet, now you can see how they align to our goal and see the actual value of those leads, not just a conversion rate, not just a cost per click, not just a click-through rate. It becomes how valuable that particular channel is to your business and you can really–like you said–begin to double down, being able to optimize further down that funnel about what that lead is actually worth to your business and what it looks like in ROI. It gives you a better understanding of how you can double down on those channels or change tactics.</p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> Yeah, that’s exactly right. That, when you have it set up, allows you to complete the two ingredients that give you a winning B2B strategy that’s aligned around that magic metric of qualified meetings booked each month, and what we’ll show you in our tactic-by-tactic playbook is how to optimize landing pages, how to run your remarketing, while leveraging calendar embed widgets to do exactly this. And the great part about it, again, once this is set up and aligned, your marketing and sales teams will run much more autonomously and efficiently. That sheet that we just looked at, that Mike was talking about, it’s something that marketing can generate automatically. That is your lead scoring. No longer will you have to have marketing give you one report and wait for sales to lead score, and hope that sales and marketing can agree on what’s qualified and what wasn’t, and then create a final report on what was a qualified lead. All of this can happen autonomously and self-sufficiently once you get that alignment.</p><p>And in terms of impact, traditionally, on a traditionally run sales and marketing team, your conversion rate from qualified lead to an actual meeting booked is about 10 percent. Think about that for a second. This is how grossly inefficient that is. Even amongst the qualified leads that you happen to get into your funnel, you actually convert that small percentage into actually doing a demo, actually taking that sales call. You future, if you implement these tactics laid out in this webinar, should actually be an increase as high as 30 percent, as we’ve seen at Ladder and what our clients get when we implement these types of tactics. That enormous! This change right here represents your sales team actually spending the time selling and closing. It means you can stay leaner as an organization, without having to scale inefficiently and having to hire people in roles that you can actually automate through a proper system. So the impact couldn’t be larger, and again, single-handedly, this is the exact same recipe for how Ladder scaled to over a quarter million dollars MRR with a sales team that was often times only one person and has never gone above two.</p><h2> <strong>5 B2B Sales Tactics to Execute Growth Strategy</strong></h2><p>First step, goes into that automated lead qualification workflow. We’re going to show you exactly how Ladder does this on our own site. The very first step of course is to capture some information. Whether it’s a single input email capture like you see here or a five-input submission request, it doesn’t really matter. Ultimately, you’re going to have this one first step, but they key is what that step falls into.</p><p>Most often, when companies get people to submit demo requests, they basically get a page that says, “Hey, thanks for saying hi and requesting information. Someone from our sales team will be in touch.” What you want to actually start doing first is doing that qualification now when your prospects are most warm and they have a high propensity to care about your company. At Ladder, as you’ll see four different questions we ask. This represents our entire qualification flow. Depending upon what somebody answers, that equals is it qualified or is it not. You can use as many as four questions in our experience, or you can use as few as one. To be totally candid, at Ladder right now, we’ve seen that the only question that actually matters is the “what’s your monthly marketing budget?”. So it’s possible to do this with simply one question being asked and then scored. </p><p>One note on that actually as well, is that right there took our development team about five hours to complete. You can use a tool called Typeform, it’s basically a SaaS solution that will allow you to do the exact same thing, and if you do that, you’re looking at less than one hour of implementation time that even a non-technical user can do. The second tactic though goes back to that calendar embed widget. How you actually rally around that magic metric of calendar slots being booked by your prospects, is to leverage calendar embed widgets. There are a bunch out there. We use HubSpot, but there’s free software like Calendly that you can use that will allow your prospects to book in calendars automatically. They see this right after they fill out their information. Don’t allow them to forget about you. Right now is the time when your prospects actually want to book a meeting with you. Give them the chance. Make it seamless and reduce friction. When Ladder put this change up, it increased our intro call conversion rates by 47 percent in just two months. </p><p>Next up, we have automated email drips. You’ll notice that the way we leverage our email drips, we leverage the same winning tactics around that calendar embed widget, that again is consistent with the strategy of the magic metric of qualified meetings booked each and every month. The recipe that Ladder uses is essentially–okay, right now, we have prospects give us their information. We then give them the chance to book automatically through that calendar embed widget on our website. What happens to those who don’t? </p><p>Still, there’s a lot you can do to automate the process of calendar meetings being booked without burdening your sales team. The way you do that is through an automated email drip. The key though is what’s the call to action in the emails that you send? Traditionally, sales teams send emails that say, “Hey, thanks for saying hi to us. When’s a good time to chat?” That’s extremely inefficient. Prospects are really busy, it’s a high-friction process just to actually schedule appointments. There’s software out there raising tons of money just trying to automate the role in the admin function of having to schedule meetings in the first place through email. A better way of doing it is in your emails, make your call to action short and straight to the point: “Saw you just requested information about us, you can book a meeting, here’s a link.” Click. What we do in the second, third, and fourth emails is actually flip it a little bit. So, if by the second email, somebody hasn’t booked yet, the right strategy is actually to lead with content. It can be content that you’ve written yourself, it could be content that’s on a third-party site, just make it relevant; however, make the upsell and the secondary call-to-action that calendar embed widget. Right now, again, you’ve given prospects that requested information a great opportunity to book a meeting in your calendar, without your sales team having to lift a finger.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> And I think it’s important, before we go to that next slide, I think it’s important to look at the automated drip sequence and know that it’s less about repetition. If we’re looking at a four-series drip, that tries to get people to book that next appointment, to take the next logical step in the relationship we’re building here, we don’t need to hammer that point home. The goal isn’t to throw this call to action at them four times and hopes it sticks. The goal is to look at value you can provide and the timing of that offer as well. Like you said, we’re looking to capture them when they’re most warm, most ready, have higher propensity to take that first action. The further away you get, the most value we’re going to have to provide upfront in those emails, whether that’s your own or third-party-content. But take a look at the timing as well. It’s important. Like I said, I don’t want you thinking that this is just about repetition, but a lot about the psychology behind the value provided and the timing of those emails themselves. </p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. That also goes back into sales tactic five around retargeting. One trend you should notice right know is these are traditionally known as marketing tactics, however, they’re being applied to your sales organization. You can do that and you can be very opportunistic because you’ve aligned your marketing and sales around that True North metric of meetings booked per month. If you didn’t do that, it would be really weird to ask your marketing team to spend time running retargeting campaigns for leads who already submitted requests. Again, this goes back to giving your qualified prospects every opportunity–automatically, without anyone in sales having to lift a finger–the chance to book a meeting in calendar. Right here, you’ll see content-based offers. This follows the same strategy we use in those email drips. For leads who just booked, you can run retargeting campaigns where the call to action is just “Hey, book a meeting.” </p><p>And again, it goes back to that calendar embed widget. For other people though, run content first, but again, same exact strategy. This is really holistic. When you push people back to your blog or some piece of content, have that calendar embed widget pop back up on a Sumo popup. Always have that calendar embed widget chasing them around to give them the chance to book automatically. That allows you to optimize exclusively for calendar meetings booked every single month. That allows your marketing and sales to work as hard as possible for one another around that True North goal. That makes marketers really happy. That makes salespeople really happy. And again, what really drives value for your company is qualified leads booking meetings with sales. That is the only way your sales team spends time doing what you want them to do. The more time sales spends talking to actual prospects, the more money and ROI your company will make. This magic metric is aligned exclusively around just that. </p><p>All these tactics allow, in a pretty holistic way, for marketing and sales to work together in achieving that. Recapping things, we have that calendar embed widget now be leveraged through retargeting campaigns, through email automation drips, and even the on-site workflow, and the final ingredient there being the workflow itself doing the lead scoring automatically. Taking a step back, every single time your marketing team is spending time on a source or a tactic, not actually driving a qualified lead, every single time marketing needs to have a meeting with sales to discuss the latest  report that you have to build, that difference is your current marketing team being able to implement these types of tactics that directly increase ROI by optimizing towards the number of meetings that you book every single month from qualified leads. </p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Well put. And also worth noting, especially here in the retargeting campaigns, looking at content-based offers, like we got right here–how we achieve marketing test success rates 300% higher than the market and beginner’s guide to funnel analysis. This is an opportunity for you to continue to validating those buyers’ personas that we talked about earlier, by seeking to understand what’s most important to them. This is a chance to test content offers, to test value propositions, copy, what pain points are your particular clients seeking to solve, what offers work best for them–and even something like this, how initiated are they? What step of the process are they in? Are they really looking to dig down deeper into testing, do they have a lot of marketing tests going, or are they in the beginner steps? Are they not ready for all the heavy-handed language. This is a chance to test a lot of different things and validate those personas. </p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> Yeah that’s exactly it Mike, and we’ll get into another bonus tactic here, but even the bonus tactic goes back to that point of when you align marketing and sales around growth, when growth equals more monthly revenue, and when you make it measurable through that magic metric of qualified meetings being booked each month, you create really virtuous cycles. Suddenly, marketing is spending time actually doing jobs that your sales teams might have to do normally. That means your sales team is spending time actually closing deals. When your sales team is closing deals, that means your marketing team has more budget and more focus and direction to double down and focus on the very sources that they know drove those qualified leads closing in the first place. That’s the antithesis of what we saw earlier in the first slide–the tug-of-war. Suddenly, you have everybody working together towards actual value creation for your company. </p><p>And one little bonus tactic here goes back to the fact that, when you go back to working with the type of B2B strategy, and having marketing and sales get aligned, you should start finding lots of interesting opportunities to optimize more and more towards that. For instance, if you have a blog, it’s simply low-hanging fruit to take that winning formula and ingredients, and start embedding that very same workflow into other places on your site. When you have that calendar embed widget working really well, you can suddenly make it so when people visit your site five times or more, maybe they automatically see that widget popup right away. These are additional tactics we didn’t cover, but they all fall into that holistic strategy of alignment on that magic metric, leveraging a small set of tools, all of them actually can be free, require very little engineering time, but transform the way your company is run. </p><p>And I know Mike mentioned this at the start of the webinar, but all of the tactics we’ve went over today, these are tactics that Ladder has used and vetted on ourselves as well as our clients.–and there’s a lot more out there. We’ve covered some of the big ones we think can instantly, in terms of how easy they are to implement, transform the way your company is run and immediately make an impact when it comes to your bottom line. That said, we have over 50 sales-relate tactics, very similar to the strategies that we talked about today, in our own private database. One thing everybody’s going to get who joined today is free, unlimited access to Ladder’s own playbook, where you can explore and look at all the tactics that exist and are out there. And feel free anytime to ping us at if you want any help on troubleshooting how these tactics are implemented in your environment.</p><h2><strong>Q&amp;A: How to Implement These Sales Tactics For Your Business</strong></h2><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Alright, let’s take a couple of questions here. I got a handful that came in. Guys, if you have any other questions, anything you want to go back over, slides you want to re-see, feel free to hit the Q&amp;A box, should be down there I believe on your left-hand side. Let’s kick a few of these off. Let’s see. Seems like there’s a lot. Where do I start? Paralysis by analysis can really be difficult to overcome and even looking at that last slide, we have tons of different tactics, lots of opportunity. Question is what do you recommend as starting points and how do you establish scope so that you and your team don’t end up down a rabbit hole. That’s a good one to start with. </p><p><strong>Jon: </strong>Yeah, I think the best way of doing it goes back to that fundamental priority to get alignment in the first place. Hold a meeting and get people on the same page on marketing and sales of what your new KPI is going to be. Once you get people bought in, it actually simplifies the game. It goes back to those two key ingredients. One, how do you qualify leads automatically in the first place? Two, how do you get more meetings booked automatically? A simple way of making that more actionable would be, even before you implement the workflow online, in terms of that automated lead scoring, just having marketing and sales map out the questions in the first place. That’s a really good first step once you get alignment on the magic KPI to start with. On the calendar embed side, I think one of the best ways you can go about it is just, like, finalize the tool you’re going to use, whether it’s Calendly, HubSpot, or some other solution, just finalize what you’re going to use. That removes a lot of the excessive paralysis around having to figure out what kind of software it’s going to be, it makes everything more real, and you’re that much closer to actually implement a lot of what we spoke about today. </p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Excellent. Alright, we have another one here–and this dovetails into your last question here, is what tools are you using to automate email workflows? </p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> Yeah so actually at Ladder, even at our size, we still use Mailchimp. It’s a free tool, really efficient and scales cheaply. We use MailChimp because it integrates via webhooks with many services that are out there. For instance, if you’re using Calendly or HubSpot for your calendar embed widget, there’s ways of integrating that directly with MailChimp so that they’re speaking together. It just saves you a lot of time of the development side and again, it just makes things more frictionless when it comes to setting up a system like this. So MailChimp is what we use and yeah, that’s actually it. It’s really simple, but again, what we’ve found here at Ladder is finding the formula and the winning strategy is the hard part. Actually finding the five tactics that will really drive growth is the difficult thing to do. The actual implementation, and the actual number of things that you have to do, often times is a lot less than you think. </p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> That’s actually a nice segway into our next question, and it comes from the last slide of ours, the tactic slide. A tactic sounds like it could be about just about anything. What do you do to ensure that you’re not just moving around the deck of chairs?</p><p><strong>Jon: </strong>Yeah again, it really goes back to alignment. There’s lots of tactics that you could do, even the Ladder Playbook has 50+. Alignment, though, helps you give proper prioritization. The simple way of doing it, make whoever is recommending a new tactic answer the following question: how will this increase, measurably, the number of qualified meetings that get booked each month? If someone can’t answer, in 10 seconds or less, that question, you’re moving deck chairs around. If they can answer it, it’s probably a worthy-while tactic to try out. </p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: I like it. That sounds like the “pizza rule” for meetings. If you can’t have a meeting that can be controlled by one or two pizzas, you have too many people in the meeting. It’s good to be able to have those little nuggets there. Question–ah, here we go, perfect right into the meetings. How often should sales and marketing be getting together to refine the process and make sure everything is working the way the way that it should?</p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> Really, a simple weekly meeting is more efficient. Again, because those reports are being generated now are going to happen a lot more self-sufficiently from marketing, because you’re not going to have to spend time–and there’s this big lag on marketing doing their own report, and then sales doing their own report, and retroactively having to consolidate them together, that allows you to operate a lot more agile and a lot more efficient. So with that said, I recommend a weekly meeting, simply to review, again, the number of qualified meetings that got booked each week. That’ a great way to staying in touch, and a way marketing and sales brainstorming to hopefully go back an find new interesting tactics that can answer the litmus question of how does this improve the number of qualified meetings being booked in a really aggressive way. So again, it goes back to you saving tons of time doing inefficient things that can be automated and is made more transparent, that allows your people to be more aggressive about doubling down on winning formulas. </p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>Sounds good. So that’s the end of the questions. If we have any other questions out there, think about the tactics we looked at today, sales alignment, actual implementation of these tactics, or anything about the Ladder Planner that you guys are going to have access to. Happy to answer some of you questions about that as well. If there’s no other ones, I think we’re going to close this out for the day. How’s everyone going to get access to the Ladder Planner?</p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> Good question. That will be emailed to everyone. So whatever email you registered with, within the next 24 hours, you’ll get access to that Ladder Playbook. Again, it’ll be self-serve, unlimited access for you and your team. Feel free to dive right in. These are the same tactics, the same playbook that Ladder uses for ourselves, and the same playbook and tactic that we use for all of our clients. </p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Alright, I think that’s about our time for today. We appreciate you sticking with us. I hope you got some good information out of it. Be looking for–oh, here we go! I got one last question. How are you considering synergies for tactics to filter relevant tactics? </p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> One more time. Repeat that one.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> How are you considering synergy in between tactics to filter relevant tactics from irrelevant ones? </p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> Interesting question. You could have 100 things you could choose from, right. But I think what the question is really asking is how can you prioritize? Well, the only way you can prioritize is first by filtering out what is an unqualified tactic. I think that step, you solve by simply forcing yourself to answer this question, after a month of implementation, how will this help us get more qualified meetings booked? The second half of the question that’s about prioritization, which is a very interesting one, and honestly. Amongst qualified tactics, it is more guesswork, which basically just means it’s based upon your personal experience in terms of what you’ve seen work really well and your intuition. One reason why Ladder does really well is that we have a lot of knowledge built up within our company, so when we can’t do something has doesn’t have a pre-existing playbook written up for it, and we don’t have data that says do this and do that, we basically guess really well. We have really good informed opinions that allow us to basically make choices in the absence of complete information with a really high degree of accuracy. I say one final way of answering that question though is actually by time it takes for you to implement. If there’s two qualified tactics, but one is going to take you 10 hours of engineering time and five hours of design, one is going to take you 1 hour of design and 1 hour of engineering time, unless your team is massive, the tactic that takes less time, you probably want to prioritize faster. </p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Alright, sounds good. If there’s no more questions, I think next steps–everybody d keep an eye out for the link in the email itself. Get yourself set up on the planner, if you have any questions, feel free to drop us a line, let us know what you’re working on and what we can do to help set up and get you pointed in the right direction. </p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> Sounds good, and like Mike said, any follow up question about what you learned today or the tactics we outlined can be implemented in your particular business environment, feel free to email us, we’ll be happy to answer those. </p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Alright, we’ll close this out. We’ll see you next time. Do keep an eye out for our next upcoming webinar. We’ll have some good stuff for you.
