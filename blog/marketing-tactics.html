But there are a few key differences between them which you should understand as you read through this post.</p><h3>What Is A Marketing Strategy?</h3><p>Generally, a marketing strategy refers to the top-level direction of your marketing. It helps you decide where you should allocate your resources and how you’ll gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. More importantly, a marketing strategy helps you lay out exactly how you’ll achieve your long-term marketing objectives.</p><p>Some long-term marketing goals and objectives may include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Entering a new target market</li><li>Launching a new product</li><li>Increasing sales</li><li>Acquiring new customers</li><li>Retaining existing customers (reducing churn)</li><li>Boosting customer satisfaction</li><li>Re-branding</li><li>Launching a new internal or external initiative</li></ul><p>Regardless of which type of marketing objective you pursue, your business goals should be specific.</p><h4>Make Your Marketing Goals Specific</h4><p>For example, what business doesn’t want to increase sales? But unless you have a specific number to work toward, you’ll have no way to measure the effectiveness of your strategy. Instead of setting an objective like “increase sales,” a better objective might be “increase sales by 15% in the next six months.”</p><p>The same logic applies to other types of business objectives. For example, you could try to reduce churn by a certain percentage or gain a specific amount of marketing penetration when entering a new market.</p><p>Your main marketing strategy will also determine which channels you should pursue. You could have a different strategy for each channel depending on your objective, or you could house multiple channels under a single strategy.</p><p>Depending on your market, you may want to use a mix of online and offline channels:</p><figure><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60f191baca28e09c78e51591_online-tactics-vs-offline-tactics.png" alt="online tactics vs offline tactics"></div><figcaption>(<a href="https://www.business2community.com/marketing/7-offline-marketing-strategies-support-online-brand-01191059">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>A few of the most popular marketing channels include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Digital advertising</li><li>Blogging</li><li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li><li>Email marketing</li><li>Social Media Marketing (SMM)</li><li>PR marketing</li><li>Event marketing</li></ul><p>You’re probably already familiar with these channels. But as we mentioned before, you can’t just set up a campaign on one of them, hit “Run,” and hope for the best. If you’re lucky, you might see some positive metrics, but doing this just won’t lead to sustainable business growth.</p><h3>What Is A Business Growth Strategy?</h3><p>And this is where it’s important to understand how a marketing strategy fits into your overall <a href="growth-strategies.html">business growth strategy</a>. There’s a difference between the two terms (and businesses have varying opinions about how to define both).</p><p>As mentioned before, your marketing strategy determines the direction of your marketing in relation to specific goals. It will also help you determine how you’re going to spend your marketing budget and how you’ll incorporate variables like messaging, creative, production, and distribution.</p><p>Your growth strategy goes far beyond marketing, although marketing is an important part of it. The marketing side determines how you’ll gain and retain new business and revenue, which will give you <em>the capacity </em>to grow. But your growth strategy encompasses all the methods you’ll use to grow your company as a whole and what steps you’ll take to accommodate for that growth.</p><p>Your growth strategy accounts for revenue size, the number of employees and teams you have, your employee diversity, talent retention, cash flow, financing, and even your R&amp;D efforts in addition to your ability to grow your market share. It should answer a question like, “When we penetrate this new market, what teams do we need in place to provide support to our new customers?” Even company mergers and acquisitions can become a part of your successful growth strategy.</p><p>While your marketing strategy helps you set long-term goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) for your marketing, your growth strategy helps you determine what you want your business to look like months and years from now.</p><h3>What Are The Different Types Of Marketing Tactics?</h3><p>Marketing tactics are smaller-scale activities you can use to gain a better ROI from your marketing strategies. Similarly, a “growth tactic” is a type of activity you engage in to grow the scope and effectiveness of your marketing strategy.</p><p>For example, if you look at the “Conversion” section in our list of growth tactics at the bottom of the page, you’ll see that the first tactic in the section suggests you eliminate links on your landing pages. This is because if you have too many links on a landing page, it encourages your visitors to navigate away.</p><p>This is a pretty small action to take in the grand scheme of things. But, as cited, it usually produces an increased return on investment (ROI) of about +38%.</p><p>There are hundreds of other tactics you can use to improve the effectiveness of your campaigns. The best marketing tactics are developed through experience, experimentation, and analysis of data and your marketing results.<br></p><h2>How to Use Marketing Tactics for Business Growth</h2><p>Just because marketing tactics tend to be smaller actions doesn’t mean they can’t contribute to your overall business growth. As you can see below, we segment our tactics into 6 strategic categories, each of which relates to how you can increase your customer base and grow your market share:</p><h3>The 6 Marketing Tactics</h3><ul role="list"><li>Acquisition</li><li>Activation</li><li>Conversion</li><li>Retention</li><li>Referral</li><li>Revenue</li></ul><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60f191b9d32a1a632f6c6215_marketing_strategists-1470162122317.png" alt="marketing strategists"></div></figure><p><strong>Acquisition tactics </strong>typically draw potential customers to your website, your landing pages, and your other online assets. Most marketers would say acquisition tactics help you increase your traffic. The best acquisition tactics help you attract your target audience more effectively, develop more personalized creative assets, and improve your SEO.</p><p><strong>Activation tactics </strong>are those that encourage your visitors to take action once you’ve drawn them in. All marketers love to see their traffic go up, but if none of that traffic is leading to action, it isn’t driving growth. Activation tactics usually pertain to your calls to action (CTAs), your email and social media strategies, and the usability of your website.</p><p><strong>Conversion tactics </strong>come into play once you’re getting potential customers on your site and generating new leads. People are giving you their info — now comes the hard part:<strong>You need to convince them to buy something</strong>.</p><p>To boost your ROI in this category, you’ll need to use tactics which target your landing pages, your discount offers, as well as the social proof you display on your website and elsewhere. If you rely on a sales team to close deals, you can also develop sales tactics to improve in this area.</p><p><strong>Retention tactics </strong>help you retain customers once they convert. If you’ve ever seen someone complain online that they’ve abandoned a company due to horrible customer service, they’re referring to this category.</p><p>You can improve your retention by targeting your onboarding and customer support efforts, your user experience (UX) and user interface (UI), and by winning back customers you’ve lost (reactivation).</p><p><strong>Referral tactics </strong>typically apply to your referral program, but they can also apply to the way you use influencers. Social media influencers, professional bloggers, and thought leaders can all be viable sources of referrals.</p><p>Once you’ve developed a solid base of customers and dazzled them with your amazing products and customer service, you can start encouraging them to bring in new business through referrals. To do this, you need a formal referral program — a strategy you can replicate and repeat as needed.</p><p>Finally, <strong>revenue tactics </strong>help you drive revenue growth.</p><p>That’s what it’s all about, right? Unfortunately, you can’t go straight to revenue growth without tackling the other categories on this list first. You might get some quick wins if you do, but you won’t be able to develop a sustainable revenue strategy.</p><p>Most revenue tactics apply to your product pricing, your retargeting efforts, and your affiliate programs and partnerships.</p><h3>How Do You Develop a Business Growth/Marketing Tactic?</h3><p>Businesses used to have to make an educated guess based on their understanding of their audience, then use their imaginations to come up with new marketing tactics. They could then test the tactic, record the results, and improve the tactic based on their findings.</p><p>For example, here’s an example of how <a href="ab-testing.html">A/B testing</a> is used to validate a new marketing tactic. In this case, it’s as simple as changing the color and layout of a button on a CTA:</p><figure><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60f191b9eecdc5f26d66294b_A-B_testing_example.png" alt="A/B testing example"></div><figcaption>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>While this model still works (who doesn’t use A/B testing?), you should not just ‘throw spaghetti at a wall’ and randomly test whatever ideas are top of mind.</p><p>The best way to develop a new business growth/marketing tactic is to use past experimentation data and recent insights to double-down on what’s working or to answer a specific question.</p><p>For example, you might want to test various value propositions to see which resonates best. To start, you’ll want to have distinct landing pages and ads crafted to speak holistically to each value proposition – where the copy, images, and ad message all align with one value prop. Then, once you’ve identified a best-performer, you’ll want to double down and test smaller facets of the experience. Eventually, you’ll have worked from an unknown to a highly optimized understanding of what works best. We’ve used this approach with all our clients, which is why we’re able to provide you with so many examples below.</p><p><strong><em>*NOTE:</em></strong><em>There’s no need to reinvent the wheel. Marketers have been trying new tactics for decades, and you can find all sorts of new ideas if you do some research. </em><strong><em>We built a database of over </em></strong><a href="../playbook.html"><strong><em>800+ marketing tactics </em></strong></a><strong><em>that you can explore for free.</em></strong></p><h3>What Makes a Successful Marketing Tactic?</h3><p>Tactics can only be considered successful if they improve your return on investment (ROI) for a particular strategy – and they are generally more narrowly focused on improving some specific key performance indicator (KPI). In other words, they must produce a better return for every dollar you spend on a marketing strategy.</p><p>For example, let’s say a customer signs up for your email list. They’ll expect to receive emails that are relevant to them. But you could improve your retention rate by sending them a series of customized emails reminding them that they opted in.</p><p>After all, most people don’t keep tabs on all the email lists they’ve signed up for. They’ll be less likely to unsubscribe if you remind them why they signed up in the first place. By improving the retention rate of your email list, you can indirectly improve sales and revenue. This tactic typically has a success rate of +20%.</p><h3>Refining Your Marketing Tactics to Drive Business Growth</h3><p>By refining your marketing tactics at every stage of your funnel and in every category listed above, you’ll be able to drive more business growth.</p><p>Eventually, every small tactical win will compound to improve your understanding and your marketing strategy. As mentioned above, your tactics and strategies should be geared toward answering questions about your business model, your target personas, your product/service offerings, or the market as a whole. And as you begin to ship tactics that fill in these answers you’ll want to refine your strategy and minimize resource waste be continuously compounding insights and doubling down on what you’ve learned to be driving performance.<br></p><h2>The Best Types of Marketing Strategies for Business Growth</h2><p>Today, the number of marketing strategies you can try are as wide and varied as the number of products available to the average consumer. We’ve come a long way from traditional marketing, which revolved around “the 4 P’s”:</p><figure><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60f191badb4eed989e947b69_the-four-ps-of-marketing.png" alt="the four P&#x27;s of marketing"></div><figcaption>(<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/get-ready-the-four-ps-of-marketing-for-indie-game-developers">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The strategies you choose depend on a lot of factors, such as which channels your customers frequent and what your budget looks like. Organic (or inbound) strategies like content marketing are cheaper, but they take a lot of time to execute and show results. Digital ads can help you generate results quickly, but they require you to spend some money to be effective.</p><h3>What are the Best Marketing Strategies for Achieving Business Growth?</h3><p>Most businesses use a mix of paid marketing strategies and organic marketing strategies to grow. Naturally, organic strategies still cost money because you must pay someone to execute them. They’re just more sustainable: You just don’t have to invest a per-dollar amount into each initiative as you do with a paid campaign.</p><p>Successful paid marketing strategies include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising</li><li>Social media ads</li><li>Search advertising (Google Ads)</li><li>Influencer marketing</li><li>Banner ads</li><li>Ad retargeting</li><li>Print media advertising</li><li>Direct mail marketing</li><li>Hosting events</li></ul><p>Meanwhile, successful organic marketing strategies to consider are:</p><ul role="list"><li>Content marketing</li><li>Social media marketing</li><li>Search engine optimization (SEO)</li><li>Email marketing (newsletters)</li><li>Video marketing</li><li>Design and other forms of creative marketing</li><li>UX and UI</li><li>Account-based marketing</li></ul><p>While most businesses don’t use all these strategies at once, they may rely on a mix of them in order to grow. For example, it’s not uncommon for a business to maintain a blog (content marketing) and promote their new blog posts using social media ads. And, although it may not be the answer you want to hear – the reality is that every business is so different that there’s no way to truthfully say which strategies are best without understanding your own funnel economics.</p><p><strong><em>*NOTE</em></strong><em>: Since understanding your current benchmarks and funnel economics are so critical to prioritizing growth strategies and marketing tactics, </em><strong><em>we’ve codified our proven framework into </em></strong><a href="growth-marketing-blueprint.html"><strong><em>an interactive growth blueprint</em></strong></a><strong><em> template that you can access for free. </em></strong><em>Just fill in the inputs and see your own funnel economics highlight the strategies you should focus on.</em></p><h3>What Makes a Marketing Strategy Successful for Business Growth?</h3><p>While the ultimate goal of any successful marketing strategy is to help you grow your business, getting there can be a challenge.</p><p>It’s difficult to measure a metric like “brand awareness,” for example. Everyone wants it, but you don’t always know you’ve achieved it until you can see the results in other, more quantitative areas, such as in your revenue and lead generation metrics.</p><p>Nonetheless, the simplest way to determine if a marketing strategy is contributing to business growth is to measure its ROI. If the revenue you’re receiving from the strategy is greater than the revenue you’re putting in, you can call it a successful strategy.</p><p>Here’s a basic marketing ROI calculation from<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/a-refresher-on-marketing-roi"> Harvard Business Review</a>:</p><figure><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60f191b940af70cfa076cc94_marketing-roi-formula.png" alt="marketing ROI formula"></div><figcaption>(<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/a-refresher-on-marketing-roi">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, some strategies will be more successful than others when it comes to ROI. The one downside to using this method is that it doesn’t always account for the long-term implications of a marketing strategy.</p><p>For example, if you launch a series of Facebook “likes” campaigns, you may not see much return on investment until months, even years down the line. You don’t earn revenue when people follow your Facebook page. But that new influx of followers could provide a huge return later when you’re promoting your hot new product through Facebook.</p><p>It’s up to you to determine which KPIs are indicators of success for each marketing strategy. To do this, set specific goals for each strategy before you execute them. And how do you set those goals in the first place? Well, you’ll need to <a href="https://try.ladder.io/growth-marketing-audit/">audit your current business funnels</a> to identify where your strengths and weakness are.</p><p><strong><em>*NOTE</em></strong><em>: We wrote a comprehensive </em><a href="marketing-funnel.html"><em>marketing funnel growth guide</em></a><em> which you should leverage.</em></p><h3>Developing Business Growth &amp; Marketing Strategies</h3><p>Too many businesses pick a strategy from a list and run with it, only to learn later that it wasn’t the best strategy for their audience. To develop a new growth/marketing strategy, you need to do research and collect data first.</p><p>To build a new marketing strategy, do the following:</p><ul role="list"><li>Understand your customers and your target audience</li><li>Research your competitors’ strategies</li><li>Choose the most viable marketing channels</li><li>Develop a marketing and sales funnel</li><li>Set specific marketing goals and KPIs</li><li>Develop a marketing plan of action</li></ul><p>Surprisingly, <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-strategy/">almost half (45%) of companies </a>don’t have a documented digital marketing strategy.</p><p>The final piece, your <a href="marketing-plan.html">marketing plan</a>, is one of the most important parts of your strategy. It’s also a piece that too many businesses leave out.</p><p>Your marketing plan should be more like a schedule, dictating what you will execute and when as your strategy unfolds. It also describes how you will spend every dollar of your marketing budget. It’s important to bake some flexibility into your marketing plan, as the market may change while you are executing it. You may also need to adjust your plan at certain times to take advantage of new opportunities or avoid unforeseen risks.</p><p>Altogether, your marketing strategy, marketing plan, and any marketing tactics you use therein should support your business growth strategy.<br></p><h2>The Importance of Data-Driven Growth Tactics for Business</h2><p>Developing growth tactics should never happen in isolation. When we develop our own tactics, we don’t just try new things and hope for the best. We use a process of experimentation and analysis to pin down which tactics provide the best ROI. Then, we document those tactics and try to improve them.</p><p>We’ve conducted over 8,000 experiments this way, which is why we manage to drive a <a href="growth-marketing.html">300% higher success rate </a>on marketing tests than the market average.</p><p>Being data-driven means making strategic decisions based on evidence, data analysis, and the interpretation of previously attained results. (It’s also why we’re not fan’s of the <a href="growth-strategy.html">ICE tactic scoring framework</a> made popular by GrowthHackers.com). Our goal is to remove as much guesswork from your decision-making process as possible, reducing the risk that your new initiatives will fail.</p><h3>What is a Data-Driven Growth Strategy?</h3><p>A data-driven growth strategy is like other data-driven initiatives, but it applies to the whole company rather than any singular department. Building a data-driven growth strategy can be a challenge mainly because it is a company-wide initiative. It also requires the company to develop new capabilities.</p><p>For example, harvesting data from a single source such as CRM isn’t enough to build a company-wide strategy. First, you must be able to identify and manage multiple sources of data, both internal and external. These data sources may come from your internal analytics tools in various departments or from other sources, such as your advertising, social media, and content management platforms.</p><figure><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60f191baad8f933bcd96b1fe_big-data-sources.png" alt="big-data sources"></div><figcaption>(<a href="https://www.smartdatacollective.com/big-data-20-free-big-data-sources-everyone-should-know/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Second, you must be able to draw insights and build predictive models based on the data you collect. This way, you can optimize your future business outcomes, predict challenges, and plan how you intend to grow.</p><p>Finally, you must be able to manage change within your organization and act based on your models and data insights. This is the most critical piece of a data-driven growth strategy. Unless you can turn data into insights and insights into action, your data collection activities don’t truly provide value.</p><p>If you don’t already have a data-driven growth strategy, take incremental steps to get there. You can start by refining your capabilities and identifying your most important sources of data.</p><h3>What is Data-Driven Marketing?</h3><p>Data-driven marketing is the process of gaining insights through the analysis of numbers or raw data. Strategies and tactics are then built upon these insights to enhance the chances of successful marketing efforts in the future.</p><p>Data may be collected from a variety of marketing sources, such as digital ad performance, content performance, and information collected through customer interactions.</p><p>Larger companies who have the capability to collect and analyze massive amounts of data may use big data analytics to produce insights. But the primary goal of data-driven marketing is to enhance the customer experience through more personalized, contextually accurate marketing strategies.</p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2018/03/05/the-rise-of-the-data-driven-marketer-why-its-beneficial-and-how-to-hire-one/#2844112490df">Over 40% of brands </a>plan to expand their data-driven marketing budgets in the future, and most companies have already incorporated some type of data analysis into their marketing apparatus.</p><h3>Why are Data-Driven Decisions Good for Business Growth?</h3><p>Put simply, data-driven decisions are better for growth because they are decisions which are based on evidence.</p><p>In the past, both marketing and business growth strategies were wholly reliant on past models and speculation to build their growth strategies. This introduced a great deal of risk. Using data-driven insights reduces that risk because it enables you to identify real opportunities and better predict risks.</p><h2>A Resource for Growth: 200+ Top Growth Marketing Tactics</h2><p>Below you’ll find the highest-performing business growth tactics Ladder has used over the last 4 years to drive growth for our 200+ clients – from startups like Monzo Bank and 8tracks, to big brands like Booking.com and Nestle.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60f191bab955fd10366f826d_ladder_testimonial-1470318912799.png" alt="testimonial on Ladder&#x27;s marketing prowess"></div></figure><p>Here’s what you get with each data-driven growth tactic:</p><ul role="list"><li>The average success rate, proven by numerous tests</li><li>A brief description of each growth tactic</li><li>An image illustrating the tactic in action</li><li>A “Learn More” link with further information about the tactic</li></ul><p>Some are free, some require a media budget (marked with $).

Try giving away a description or excerpt of the content for free in the landing page to further drive interest.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/609a85ad373eb0a673093534_wfYJWJxZMByu45YjM_1468964545878_476._Gated_Content_Landing_Page.png" alt="Gated Content Landing Page"></div></figure><p><a href="http://try.ladder.io/planner/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=landing-pages" target="_blank"><strong>TEST THIS TACTIC</strong></a></p><h4>Search Page Destination</h4><p><em>This tactic doesn’t require media budget</em></p><p>Increase conversion rate by sending traffic to a specific landing page that matches the ad messaging/creative. There are very few instances when you should send someone to your homepage, generally you want people to take an action and homepages are full of distractions, AND they have too many variables that won’t match your ad copy/creative. Best practice is always to match the ads messaging/creative with the landing pages messaging/creative: this increases the relevancy and the quality score of the ad, which often increases CVR while decreasing CPC. Win-win!</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef250f9cf04f5afa8871b1_NxbZM2f4pWBPSXXQK-186.Search%2520vs.%2520Homepage%2520Destination.png" alt="Search Page Destination"></div></figure><p><a href="http://try.ladder.io/planner/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=landing-pages" target="_blank"><strong>TEST THIS TACTIC</strong></a></p><h4>Personalized Landing Pages From Share</h4><p><em>This tactic doesn’t require media budget</em></p><p>When a user shares your app with a friend, try creating a personalized landing page for that friend.

Engagement rises when landing page content more directly matches ad content. A page that’s more personalized for the audience that you’re driving to it is more likely to relate to the call to action and the message you’re trying to convey. Rather than directing to your landing page, for example, link to a contextual page based on the ad copy. I.e. webinar ad leads to webinar signup page.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/609a83a694c1ce06b63e14c6_wfYJWJxZMByu45YjM_1468961334598_449_Personal_vs._Generic_Page.png" alt="Personal Vs.
