He <a href="https://bgr.com/2015/06/18/what-its-like-to-work-for-steve-jobs/">treated people terribly</a> and even <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-jerk-2011-10#he-short-changed-his-best-friend-on-a-bonus-9">cheated his business partner out of money</a>.</p><p>How long would a guy like that last at an agency, or better yet, a client relationship?</p><figure style="padding-bottom:33.75%" class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video"><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-oIL9cLHDc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></figure><p>He <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/steve-jobs-fire-company/story?id=14683754">didn’t even last that long</a> at Apple, a company that he founded. He was forced out of Apple due to leadership conflicts with the board, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/23/steve-jobs-failure_n_1025732.html">ran NeXT into the ground</a>, was <a href="http://fortune.com/steve-jobs-pixar-apple-lawrence-levy/">hated at Pixar</a>, and was only invited back to Apple as a Hail Mary pass.</p><p>The truth is that Steve Jobs was constantly derided and unpopular… until he wasn’t.</p><p>Eventually his genius shone through, and it was only then that people started to forgive his eccentricities and the myth was born.</p><p>But at an agency, he wouldn’t have had the time he needed to shine. Even if he owned the agency, he’d not survive more than a couple of big clients leaving when he told them no.</p><p><em>“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”</em></p><ul role="list"><li>Steve Jobs</li></ul><p>I’m not saying that people who work at agencies aren’t talented. Remember, I’m the founder of an agency. I’m proud of the rockstar team we have at <a href="../index-17.htm?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=steve-jobs">Ladder</a>, and I’ve worked with plenty of smart people at other agencies.</p><p>But for agencies to become Steve Jobs as a Service? The model isn’t right. The incentives aren’t aligned.</p><p>The flipside of not losing if you fail is that if you succeed, agencies get a tiny fraction — mere decimals — of the upside.</p><p>Even if they do put in the blood, sweat, and tears needed to deliver a World-changing impact, all they is a case study and a logo to put on their website.</p><p><strong>Founders like you get to become the billionaires.</strong></p><p>If growth strategists were truly convinced they could manufacture success, they’d start their own companies and realize returns many times higher than the rate you’re paying them.</p><p>Nicholas Nassim Taleb calls this ‘<a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/SITG.html">skin in the game</a>’.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef2aa950e5380a504b2198_skin-in-the-game.png" alt="skin in the game"></div></figure><p>The fact that they’re marketing strategists at an agency rather than creating their own company means that they’re happy to trade potential upside for a predictable salary — at least for the meantime.</p><p>And that’s why <strong>SJaaS (Steve Jobs as a Service) doesn’t exist</strong>.</p><p>If the clients I quoted at the beginning of this piece understood this, the relationship would have never turned so ugly. It would have saved us a lot of psychological stress and would have saved them a lot of time and money.</p><p>I’m writing this piece largely as therapy, but if I manage to help one consultant, agency, or client avoid a doomed relationship, I’ll be happy.</p><h2>But agencies do good work!?</h2><p><br>If they’re still reading, then by now agency people are protesting, “Ugh – the ‘Think Different’ campaign that relaunched Apple came from TBWA/Chiat/Day!”</p><p>Yes, it certainly couldn’t have happened without them…</p><p>“…although the ‘‘Think Different’’ concept itself had emerged from a collaborative effort between the agency’s worldwide creative director, Lee Clow, and Steve Jobs” (<a href="https://marketing-case-studies.blogspot.com/2008/03/think-different-campaign.html">source</a>)</p><p>That’s right. The agency was involved, but it took the firepower of the worldwide creative director to get it right, and even then it only happened <strong>in direct collaboration</strong> with Jobs.</p><p>You also have to ask yourself how well that ad would have done without the $90m spent on airtime, the network premiere of the ad during Toy Story (Jobs owned Pixar), the aggressive leverage used to get famous celebrities like Muhammad Ali in the ads, and a thousand other things Jobs did on the business and product side to set Apple up for success.</p><p>If the ‘Think Different’ campaign was a bacon-and-egg sandwich, the agency was the chicken, but Steve Jobs was the bacon.</p><p>They were involved, but Jobs was committed.</p><p><strong>And really that’s how it should be.</strong></p><p><strong>In every startup, and every ambitious business.</strong></p><p>Every first year business student gets told to only outsource the parts of your business that aren’t core to what you do.</p><p><em>“Do what you do best and outsource the rest”.</em></p><ul role="list"><li>Drucker</li></ul><p>It really is business 101.</p><p>So while outsourcing is an essential part of any smart business strategy, you shouldn’t be outsourcing essential parts (i.e. the creative genius) of your business.</p><p>Nobody outside of your company has the incentives that you have to do what it takes and beat the odds. They’ll do a good job — a professional job — but they’ll never start a revolution.</p><h2>What you should do about it.</h2><p><br>If SJaaS doesn’t exist, well guess what. <strong>YOU have to be the Steve Jobs.</strong> </p><p>As a founder, you’re the only person properly incentivized to play that role. It’s your responsibility.</p><p>Don’t believe agencies or consultants that sell you the dream or imply they can turn your company into a billion-dollar business. Don’t yell at agencies or consultants who don’t deliver Jobsian magic. Don’t be surprised when an agency doesn’t revolutionize your business.</p><p>That’s not what they’re designed to do.</p><p>A great agency can <strong>greatly magnify the effect of your efforts</strong>, like Lee Clow and TBWA/Chiat/Day did for Apple. But they can’t work in a vacuum. They have to work with what they’re given, and you’re their most important resource.</p><p>Instead, outsource anything that isn’t mission-critical to your business, ignore any distractions, and hold yourself accountable for the handful of things that will move the needle. When you’re choosing what to focus on, don’t look for silver bullets; You need a whole lot of lead bullets.</p><p>When you do outsource, go into it with clear expectations.</p><p>If you don’t understand how to do something yourself, as a rule you probably don’t understand how to outsource it. You’ll hire the wrong person or pay for something you don’t even end up using. To use an exercise analogy: invest in a bike because you use Citibike every day; don’t buy a gym membership because you think it’ll magically make you work out more.</p><p>Don’t expect an agency to know your business better than you do. Go for a vendor who doesn’t sell you the dream, but talks frankly, values the fundamentals, and doesn’t assume they know what works <a href="https://blog.ladder.io/A/B Testing/">until they’ve tested it</a>.

Be <a href="http://www.brightjourney.com/q/forming-new-software-startup-allocate-ownership-fairly">generous with equity</a> so they feel fairly treated and are motivated to do all the things a third party could never cost-effectively do for you. 50% of something is worth much more than <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-much-of-your-company-should-you-give-to-an-investor">100% of nothing</a>.</p><p>For the sake of your sanity, enact a ‘<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Asshole-Rule-Civilized-Workplace-Surviving/dp/0446526568/">no a-hole rule</a>’ at your place of work.</p><p>For good measure, avoid people in black turtlenecks.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../6098e41066be8b2b7cb437cd/60ef2aa94f5e1a39a6c56e7d_silicon-valley-turtleneck.jpeg" alt="black turtleneck silicon valley"></div></figure><p>Make your own “dent in the universe”.</p><p>You can’t pay someone to do it for you. <strong>You can only pay them to magnify it.</strong></p></div><div class="w-embed"></div><h3 class="tactic-cta left">Ladder powers strategy and performance solutions for fast-growing brands<br>‍<br><a href="https://ladderdigital.typeform.com/to/CKV0sP?experiment_version=premium-revamp#3zsppzwnbhyo1vuu1248v9" target="_blank" class="talk-to-strategist-inline-cta"><span class="h3-inline-cta">Talk to a strategist →</span></a></h3></div></div><div class="blog-sections sign-up"><div class="container blog cta"><h2 class="heading-4">Growth is a high velocity game.</h2><p class="paragraph-3">Sign up to our newsletter to stay up to date with all the latest movements in the field.</p><div class="newsletter small w-form"><form id="email-form" name="email-form" data-name="Email Form" action="https://ladder.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=9e512c30baee245f2b57bc45b&amp;amp;id=9d86f56367" method="post" class="sign-up-form" data-wf-page-id="60c8e0dd23d40e4a6dae4ca3" data-wf-element-id="e1befde6-d7f4-7251-2123-4e8b4c4e50cb"><input class="email-sign-up-form w-input" maxlength="256" name="email" data-name="Email" placeholder="Enter your email here..." type="email" id="email" required=""><input type="submit" data-wait="Please wait..." class="filled-in-button orange w-button" value="Join the list"></form><div class="success-message w-form-done"><div>🎉 Thank you!
